You can see that the RGB (or any other scale you use that forms a basis in color space) are just vectors. Take a look at Random Point Picking. Hope this is a good start for you! Once you have a set of vectors that are maximized a part, you can save them in a hash table or something for later, and just perform random rotations on them to get all the colors you desire that are maximally apart from each other!

Edit: Thinking about this problem more, it would be better to map the colors in a linear manor, possibly (0,0,0) --> (255,255,255) lexicographically, and then distribute them evenly. I really don't know how well this will work, but it should since, lets say:

n = 10
we know we have 16777216 colors (256^3). We can use buckles algorithm 515 to find the lexicographically indexed color.. You'll probably have to edit the algorithm to avoid overflow and probably add some minor speed improvements.

With Apache you can set up a similar catch-all for your vhosts.  The ServerName must be a single static name but the ServerAlias directive can contain a pattern.

Servername www.ourdomain.com
ServerAlias *.ourdomain.com


Now all of the domains will trigger the vhost for our project.  The final part is to decode the domain name actually used so that you can work out the username in your code, something like (PHP):

list( $username ) = explode( ""."", $_SERVER[ ""HTTP_HOST"" ] );

http://www.bloombit.com/Articles/2008/05/ASCII-Encoded-Binary-String-Automated-SQL-Injection.aspx

http://aspadvice.com/blogs/programming_shorts/archive/2008/06/27/Asprox-Recovery.aspx

The scary thing though is that the virus looks to the system tables for values to infect and a lot of shared hosting plans also share the database space for their clients. So most likely it wasn't even your dad's site that was infected, but somebody else's site within his hosting cluster that wrote some poor code and opened the door to SQL Injection attack.

If he hasn't done so yet, I'd send an URGENT e-mail to their host and give them a link to that SQL code to fix the entire system. You can fix your own affected database tables, but most likely the bots that are doing the infection are going to pass right through that hole again and infect the whole lot.

Hopefully this gives you some more info to work with.

EDIT: One more quick thought, if he's using one of the hosts online design tools for building his website, all of that content is probably sitting in a column and was infected that way."

CPPUnitLite was created by Michael Feathers, who originally ported Java's JUnit to C++ as CPPUnit (CPPUnit tries mimic the development model of JUnit - but C++ lacks Java's features [e.g. reflection] to make it easy to use). 

CPPUnitLite attempts to make a true C++-style testing framework, not a Java one ported to C++. (I'm paraphrasing from Feather's Working Effectively with Legacy Code book). CPPUnitLite2 seems to be another rewrite, with more features and bug fixes.

Plus, the Visual Studio integration is really neat, something paper just cannot compete with. Also, if you lay the project to rest for 6 months and come back, all your tasks and notes are still there, whereas with paper you may need to search all the old documents and notes again, if you did not discard it.

But that is just the point of view from someone who is not really good at staying organized :-) If you are a really tidy and organized person, paper may work better for you than it does for me.

Bonus suggestion: Run Fogbugz on a second PC (or a small Laptop like the eeePC) so that you always have it at your fingertips.

2092,44357,4410.0,2008-09-04T18:07:31Z,3260,79,"There are lots and lots of classic peak detection methods, any of which might work.  You'll have to see what, in particular, bounds the quality of your data.  Here are basic descriptions:


Between any two points in your data, (x(0),y(0)) and (x(n),y(n)), add up y(i+1)-y(i) for 0 <= i < n and call this T (""travel"") and set R (""rise"") to y(n)- y(0) + k for suitably small k.  T/R > 1 indicates a peak.  This works OK if large travel due to noise is unlikely or if noise distributes symmetrically around a base curve shape.  For your application, accept the earliest peak with a score above a given threshold, or analyze the curve of travel per rise values for more interesting properties.
Use matched filters to score similarity to a standard peak shape (essentially, use a normalized dot-product against some shape to get a cosine-metric of similarity)
Deconvolve against a standard peak shape and check for high values (though I often find 2 to be less sensitive to noise for simple instrumentation output).
Smooth the data and check for triplets of equally spaced points where, if x0 < x1 < x2, y1 > 0.5*(y0+y2), or check Euclidean distances like this:  D((x0,y0),(x1,y1)) + D((x1,y1),(x2,y2)) > D((x0,y0),(x2,y2)), which relies on the triangle inequality.  Using simple ratios will again provide you a scoring mechanism.
Fit a very simple 2-gaussian mixture model to your data (for example, Numerical Recipes has a nice ready-made chunk of code).  Take the earlier peak.  This will deal correctly with overlapping peaks.
Find the best match in the data to a simple Gaussian, Cauchy, Poisson, or what-have-you curve.  Evaluate this curve over a broad range and subtract it from a copy of the data after noting it's peak location.  Repeat.  Take the earliest peak whose model parameters (standard deviation probably, but some applications might care about kurtosis or other features) meet some criterion.  Watch out for artifacts left behind when peaks are subtracted from the data.
Best match might be determined by the kind of match scoring suggested in #2 above.


I've done what you're doing before:  finding peaks in DNA sequence data, finding peaks in derivatives estimated from measured curves, and finding peaks in histograms.

I encourage you to attend carefully to proper baselining.  Wiener filtering or other filtering or simple histogram analysis is often an easy way to baseline in the presence of noise.

Finally, if your data is typically noisy and you're getting data off the card as unreferenced single-ended output (or even referenced, just not differential), and if you're averaging lots of observations into each data point, try sorting those observations and throwing away the first and last quartile and averaging what remains.  There are a host of such outlier elimination tactics that can be really useful.

Why it is useful in programming? No idea, but i assume it's because you can get rid of some brackets? I am a quite defensive programmer, so my lines can look like this:

result = (((i + 4) - (a + b)) * MAGIC_NUMBER) - ANOTHER_MAGIC_NUMBER;


with BODMAS you can make this a bit clearer:

result = (i + 4 - (a + b)) * MAGIC_NUMBER - ANOTHER_MAGIC_NUMBER;


I think i'd still use the first variant - more brackets, but that way i do not have to learn yet another rule and i run into less risk of forgetting it and causing those weird hard to debug errors?

Just guessing at that part though.

4080,79845,13940.0,2008-09-17T04:02:23Z,4080,60,"For static analysis tools I often use CPD, PMD, FindBugs, and Checkstyle.

CPD is the PMD ""Copy/Paste Detector"" tool. I was using PMD for a little while before I noticed the ""Finding Duplicated Code"" link on the PMD web page.

I'd like to point out that these tools can sometimes be extended beyond their ""out-of-the-box"" set of rules. And not just because they're open source so that you can rewrite them. Some of these tools come with applications or ""hooks"" that allow them to be extended. For example, PMD comes with the ""designer"" tool that allows you to create new rules. Also, Checkstyle has the DescendantToken check that has properties that allow for substantial customization.

I integrate these tools with an Ant-based build. You can follow the link to see my commented configuration.

In addition to the simple integration into the build, I find it helpful to configure the tools to be somewhat ""integrated"" in a couple of other ways. Namely, report generation and warning suppression uniformity. I'd like to add these aspects to this discussion (which should probably have the ""static-analysis"" tag also): how are folks configuring these tools to create a ""unified"" solution? (I've asked this question separately here)

First, for warning reports, I transform the output so that each warning has the simple format:

/absolute-path/filename:line-number:column-number: warning(tool-name): message

This is often called the ""Emacs format,"" but even if you aren't using Emacs, it's a reasonable format for homogenizing reports. For example:

/project/src/com/example/Foo.java:425:9: warning(Checkstyle):Missing a Javadoc comment.

My warning format transformations are done by my Ant script with Ant filterchains.

The second ""integration"" that I do is for warning suppression. By default, each tool supports comments or an annotation (or both) that you can place in your code to silence a warning that you want to ignore. But these various warning suppression requests do not have a consistent look which seems somewhat silly. When you're suppressing a warning, you're suppressing a warning, so why not always write ""SuppressWarning?""

For example, PMD's default configuration suppresses warning generation on lines of code with the string ""NOPMD"" in a comment. Also, PMD supports Java's @SuppressWarnings annotation. I configure PMD to use comments containing ""SuppressWarning(PMD."" instead of NOPMD so that PMD suppressions look alike. I fill in the particular rule that is violated when using the comment style suppression:

// SuppressWarnings(PMD.PreserveStackTrace) justification: (false positive) exceptions are chained

Only the ""SuppressWarnings(PMD."" part is significant for a comment, but it is consistent with PMD's support for the @SuppressWarning annotation which does recognize individual rule violations by name:

@SuppressWarnings(""PMD.CompareObjectsWithEquals"") // justification: identity comparision intended

Similarly, Checkstyle suppresses warning generation between pairs of comments (no annotation support is provided). By default, comments to turn Checkstyle off and on contain the strings CHECKSTYLE:OFF and CHECKSTYLE:ON, respectively. Changing this configuration (with Checkstyle's ""SuppressionCommentFilter"") to use the strings ""BEGIN SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle."" and ""END SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle."" makes the controls look more like PMD:


// BEGIN SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField) justification: ""Effective Java,"" 2nd ed., Bloch, Item 2
// END SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField)


With Checkstyle comments, the particular check violation (HiddenField) is significant because each check has its own ""BEGIN/END"" comment pair.

FindBugs also supports warning generation suppression with a @SuppressWarnings annotation, so no further configuration is required to achieve some level of uniformity with other tools. Unfortunately, Findbugs has to support a custom @SuppressWarnings annotation because the built-in Java @SuppressWarnings annotation has a SOURCE retention policy which is not strong enough to retain the annotation in the class file where FindBugs needs it. I fully qualify FindBugs warnings suppressions to avoid clashing with Java's @SuppressWarnings annotation:

@edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressWarnings(""UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR"")

These techniques makes things look reasonably consistent across tools. Note that having each warning suppression contain the string ""SuppressWarnings"" makes it easy to run a simple search to find all instances for all tools over an entire code base.

Loading libA before libB should work, unless one of those libraries has a dependency that is unaccounted for and not in the path. My understanding is that once it gets to a system loadLibrary call (i.e. Java has found the library in its java.library.path and is now telling the OS to load it) - it is completely dependent on the operating system to find any dependent libraries, because at that point it is the operating system that is loading the library for the process, and the OS only knows how to look in the system path. That seems hard to set in the case of a Webstart app, but there is a way around this that does not involve static compiling. You may be able to shuffle where your libraries are - I am unsure 

If you use a custom classloader, you can override loadLibrary and findLibrary so that it can locate your libraries from within a jar in your classpath, and if you also make it aware of your native library dependencies (i.e. libB depends on libA depends on libX, then when loading libB you can catch yourself and ensure you load libA first, and in checking that notice and load libX first.

As for the GUID vs ID argument, you can find people online that swear by both.  I have always been taught to use GUIDs unless I have a really good reason not to.  Jeff has a good post that talks about the reasons for using GUIDs: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000817.html.

As with most anything development related, if you are looking to improve performance there is not one, single right answer.  It really depends on what you are trying to accomplish and how you are implementing the solution.  The only true answer is to test, test, and test again against performance metrics to ensure that you are meeting your goals.

[Edit]
@Matt, after doing some more research on the GUID/ID debate I came across this post.  Like I mentioned before, there is not a true right or wrong answer.  It depends on your specific implementation needs.  But these are some pretty valid reasons to use GUIDs as the primary key:


  For example, there is an issue known as a ""hotspot"", where certain pages of data in a table are under relatively high currency contention. Basically, what happens is most of the traffic on a table (and hence page-level locks) occurs on a small area of the table, towards the end. New records will always go to this hotspot, because IDENTITY is a sequential number generator. These inserts are troublesome because they require Exlusive page lock on the page they are added to (the hotspot). This effectively serializes all inserts to a table thanks to the page locking mechanism. NewID() on the other hand does not suffer from hotspots. Values generated using the NewID() function are only sequential for short bursts of inserts (where the function is being called very quickly, such as during a multi-row insert), which causes the inserted rows to spread randomly throughout the table's data pages instead of all at the end - thus eliminating a hotspot from inserts.
  
  Also, because the inserts are randomly distributed, the chance of page splits is greatly reduced. While a page split here and there isnt too bad, the effects do add up quickly. With IDENTITY, page Fill Factor is pretty useless as a tuning mechanism and might as well be set to 100% - rows will never be inserted in any page but the last one. With NewID(), you can actually make use of Fill Factor as a performance-enabling tool. You can set Fill Factor to a level that approximates estimated volume growth between index rebuilds, and then schedule the rebuilds during off-peak hours using dbcc reindex. This effectively delays the performance hits of page splits until off-peak times.
  
  If you even think you might need to enable replication for the table in question - then you might as well make the PK a uniqueidentifier and flag the guid field as ROWGUIDCOL. Replication will require a uniquely valued guid field with this attribute, and it will add one if none exists. If a suitable field exists, then it will just use the one thats there.
  
  Yet another huge benefit for using GUIDs for PKs is the fact that the value is indeed guaranteed unique - not just among all values generated by this server, but all values generated by all computers - whether it be your db server, web server, app server, or client machine. Pretty much every modern language has the capability of generating a valid guid now - in .NET you can use System.Guid.NewGuid. This is VERY handy when dealing with cached master-detail datasets in particular. You dont have to employ crazy temporary keying schemes just to relate your records together before they are committed. You just fetch a perfectly valid new Guid from the operating system for each new record's permanent key value at the time the record is created.

Rational


Users don't change emails very often
Removes the step of asking for username and email address, which you'll need anyway
Users don't often forget their email address (see number one)
Email will be unique unless the user already registered for the site, in which case forward them to a forgot your password screen
Almost everyone is using email as the primary login for access to a website, this means the rate of adoption shouldn't be affected by the fact that you're asking for an email address




Update

After registration, be sure to ask the user to create some kind of username, don't litter a public site with their email address! Also, another benefit of using an email address as a login: you won't need any other information (like password / password confirm), just send them a temp password through the mail, or forgo passwords altogether and send them a one-use URL to their email address every time they'd like to login (see: mugshot.org)"

SELECT count(*) AS repcount, ""Location Name"" FROM mytable WHERE ""Company Name"" IS NULL GROUP BY ""Location Name"" ORDER BY repcount DESC LIMIT 5;

Figure out what company the location at the top of the list belongs to and then update your company name field with an UPDATE ... WHERE ""Location Name"" = ""The Location"" statement.

This is no more dangerous or critical than the normal odd file problem, and can be because of various problems, like a subversion program dying mid-change, power-disruption, etc.

Unless it happens more I wouldn't make much out of it.

It can be fixed by doing what you did, make a copy of your work-files, check out a fresh copy, and add the modified files back in.

Note that this might cause problems if you have a busy project where you would normally have to merge in changes.

For instance, you and a collegue both check out a fresh copy, and start working on the same file. At some point, your collegue checks in his modifications. When you attempt to do the same, you get the checksum problem you have. If you now make copies of your changed files, do a fresh checkout, then subversion will lose track of how your changes should be merged back in.

If you didn't get the problem in this case, when you got around to checkin in your modifications, you would need to update your working copy first, and possibly handle a conflict with your file.

However, if you do a fresh checkout, complete with your collegues changes, it now looks like you removed his changes and substituted with your own. No conflicts, and no indications from subversion that something is amiss."

WSIWIG editors (such as fckeditor) work well and give you some good options regarding the features that you allow.

Some sort of token replacement system is also a good idea if you need it.

230,7101,878.0,2008-08-10T08:37:28Z,6890,5,"How much order do you need to impose on the threads? If you just need all of the work started in the loop to finish before the code continues, but you don't care about the order the work within the loop finishes, then calling Join is the answer. To add more detail to Kevin Kenny's answer, you should call Join outside the loop. This means you will need a collection to hold references to the threads you started:

// Start all of the threads.
List<Thread> startedThreads = new List<Thread>();
foreach (...) {
  Thread thread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(MyMethod));
  thread.Start();
  startedThreads.Add(thread);
}

// Wait for all of the threads to finish.
foreach (Thread thread in startedThreads) {
  thread.Join();
}


In contrast, if you called Join inside the loop, the result would basically be the same as not using threads at all. Each iteration of the loop body would create and start a thread but then immediately Join it and wait for it to finish.

If the individual threads produce some result (write a message in a log, for example) then the messages may still appear out of order because there's no coordination between the threads. It is possible to get the threads to output their results in order by coordinating them with a Monitor.

ssh-keygen


Then go through the steps, you'll have two files, id_rsa and id_rsa.pub (the first is your private key, the second is your public key - the one you copy to remote machines)

Then, connect to the remote machine you want to login to, to the file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys add the contents of your that id_rsa.pub file.

Oh, and chmod 600 all the id_rsa* files (both locally and remote), so no other users can read them:

chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa*


Similarly, ensure the remote ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file is chmod 600 also:

chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys


Then, when you do ssh remote.machine, it should ask you for the key's password, not the remote machine.



To make it nicer to use, you can use ssh-agent to hold the decrypted keys in memory - this means you don't have to type your keypair's password every single time. To launch the agent, you run (including the back-tick quotes, which eval the output of the ssh-agent command)

`ssh-agent`


On some distros, ssh-agent is started automatically. If you run echo $SSH_AUTH_SOCK and it shows a path (probably in /tmp/) it's already setup, so you can skip the previous command.

Then to add your key, you do

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa


and enter your passphrase. It's stored until you remove it (using the ssh-add -D command, which removes all keys from the agent)

4696,92250,6112.0,2008-09-18T12:54:04Z,7440,16,"I'm a huge fan of Selenium. Saying 'unit-testing your web ui' isn't exactly accurate as some of the comments have mentioned. However, I do find Selenium to be incredibly useful for performing those sort of acceptance and sanity tests on the UI.

A good way to get started is using Selenium IDE as part of your development. Ie, just have the IDE open as you're developing and write your test as you go to cut down on your dev time. (Instead of having to manually go through the UI to get to the point where you can test whatever you're working on, just hit a button and Selenium IDE will take care of that for you. It's a terrific time-saver!)

Most of my major use case scenarios have Selenium RC tests to back them up. You can't really think of them as unit-tests along the lines of an xUnit framework, but they are tests targetted to very specific functionality. They're quick to write (especially if you implement common methods for things like logging in or setting up your test cases), quick to run, and provide a very tight feedback loop. In those senses Selenium RC tests are very similar to unit-tests.

I think, like anything else, if you put the effort into properly learning a test tool (eg, Selenium), your effort will pay off in spades. You mention that your company already uses Selenium to do UI testing. This is great. Work with it. If you find Selenium hard to use, or confusing, stick with it. The learning curve really isn't all that steep once you learn the API a little bit.

If I'm working on a web app, its rare for me to write a significant amount of code without Selenium RC tests to back it up. That's how effective I find Selenium. :) (Hopefully that'll answer your question..)

In summary


Firefox3 saves its bookmarks and history in an SQLite database
Every time you load a page it writes to this database several times
SQLite cares deeply that you don't lose your bookmarks, so each time it writes, instructs the kernel to flush it's database file to disk and ensure that it's fully written
Many variants of linux, when told to flush like that, flush EVERY FILE. This may take up to a minute or more if you have background tasks doing any kind of disk intensive stuff.
The kernel makes firefox wait while this flush happens, which locks up the UI.

Here's what I'm doing for Windows.  BTW, I'm creating .app and .dmg for Mac, but haven't figured out what to do for Linux yet.

Project Copies of launch4j and NSIS

In my project I have a ""vendor"" directory and underneath it I have a directory for ""launch4j"" and ""nsis"".  Within each is a copy of the install for each application.  I find it easier to have a copy local to the project rather than forcing others to install both products and set up some kind of environment variable to point to each.

Script Files

I also have a ""scripts"" directory in my project that holds various configuration/script files for my project.  First there is the launch4j.xml file:

<launch4jConfig>
  <dontWrapJar>true</dontWrapJar>
  <headerType>gui</headerType>
  <jar>rpgam.jar</jar>
  <outfile>rpgam.exe</outfile>
  <errTitle></errTitle>
  <cmdLine></cmdLine>
  <chdir>.</chdir>

Ant Integration

I have some targets in my Ant buildfile (build.xml) to handle the above.  First I tel Ant to import launch4j's Ant tasks:

<taskdef name=""launch4j"" 
    classname=""net.sf.launch4j.ant.Launch4jTask""
    classpath=""${launch4j.dir}/launch4j.jar:${launch4j.dir}/lib/xstream.jar"" />


I then have a simple target for creating the wrapper executable:

<target name=""executable-windows"" depends=""jar"" description=""Create Windows executable (EXE)"">
    <launch4j configFile=""scripts/launch4j.xml"" outfile=""${exeFile}"" />
</target>


And another target for making the installer:

<target name=""installer-windows"" depends=""executable-windows"" description=""Create the installer for Windows (EXE)"">
    <!-- Lay out files needed for building the installer -->
    <mkdir dir=""${windowsLayoutDirectory}"" />
    <copy file=""${jarFile}"" todir=""${windowsLayoutDirectory}"" />
    <copy todir=""${windowsLayoutDirectory}/lib"">
        <fileset dir=""${libraryDirectory}"" />
        <fileset dir=""${windowsLibraryDirectory}"" />
    </copy>
    <copy todir=""${windowsLayoutDirectory}/icons"">
         <fileset dir=""${iconsDirectory}"" />
    </copy>
    <copy todir=""${windowsLayoutDirectory}"" file=""${exeFile}"" />

        <arg value=""/DVERSION=${version}"" />
        <arg value=""scripts/rpgam-setup.nsi"" />
    </exec>
</target>


The top portion of that just copies the necessary files for the installer to a temporary location and the second half executes the script that uses all of it to make the installer.

320,9502,1131.0,2008-08-13T06:08:24Z,9240,7,"If I understand the question correctly, you've created a domain model and you would like to write an object-relational mapper to map between records in your database and your domain objects. However, you're concerned about polluting your domain model with the 'plumbing' code that would be necessary to read and write to your object's fields.

Taking a step back, you essentially have two choices of where to put your data mapping code - within the domain class itself or in an external mapping class.
The first option is often called the Active Record pattern and has the advantage that each object knows how to persist itself and has sufficient access to its internal structure to allow it to perform the mapping without needing to expose non-business related fields.

E.g

public class User
{
	private string name;
	private AccountStatus status;

	private User()
	{
	}

	public string Name
	{
		get { return name; }
		set { name = value; }
	}

	public AccountStatus Status
	{
		get { return status; }
	}

	public void Activate()
	{
		status = AccountStatus.Active;
	}

	public void Suspend()
	{
		status = AccountStatus.Suspended;
	}

	public static User GetById(int id)
	{
		User fetchedUser = new User();

		// Lots of database and error-checking code
		// omitted for clarity
		// ...

		fetchedUser.name = (string) reader[""Name""];
		fetchedUser.status = (int)reader[""statusCode""] == 0 ? AccountStatus.Suspended : AccountStatus.Active;

		return fetchedUser;
	}

	public static void Save(User user)
	{
		// Code to save User's internal structure to database
		// ...
	}
}


In this example, we have an object that represents a User with a Name and an AccountStatus. We don't want to allow the Status to be set directly, perhaps because we want to check that the change is a valid status transition, so we don't have a setter. Fortunately, the mapping code in the GetById and Save static methods have full access to the object's name and status fields.

The second option is to have a second class that is responsible for the mapping. This has the advantage of seperating out the different concerns of business logic and persistence which can allow your design to be more testable and flexible. The challenge with this method is how to expose the name and status fields to the external class. Some options are:
  1. Use reflection (which has no qualms about digging deep into your object's private parts)
  2. Provide specially-named, public setters (e.g. prefix them with the word 'Private') and hope no one uses them accidentally
  3. If your language suports it, make the setters internal but grant your data mapper module access. E.g. use the InternalsVisibleToAttribute in .NET 2.0 onwards or friend functions in C++

For more information, I'd recommend Martin Fowler's classic book 'Patterns of Enterprise Architecture'

However, as a word of warning, before going down the path of writing your own mappers I'd strongly recommend looking at using a 3rd-party object relational mapper (ORM) tool such as nHibernate or Microsoft's Entity Framework. I've worked on four different projects where, for various reasons, we wrote our own mapper and it is very easy to waste a lot of time maintaining and extending the mapper instead of writing code that provides end user value. I've used nHibernate on one project so far and, although it has quite a steep learning curve initially, the investment you put in early on pays off considerably.

A prototype for a function which takes a function parameter looks like the following:

void func ( void (*f)(int) );


This states that the parameter f will be a pointer to a function which has a void return type and which takes a single int parameter. The following function (print) is an example of a function which could be passed to func as a parameter because it is the proper type:

void print ( int x ) {
  printf(""%d\n"", x);
}


Function Call

When calling a function with a function parameter, the value passed must be a pointer to a function. Use the function's name (without parentheses) for this:

func(print);


would call func, passing the print function to it.

Function Body

As with any parameter, func can now use the parameter's name in the function body to access the value of the parameter. Let's say that func will apply the function it is passed to the numbers 0-4. Consider, first, what the loop would look like to call print directly:

for ( int ctr = 0 ; ctr < 5 ; ctr++ ) {
  print(ctr);
}


Since func's parameter declaration says that f is the name for a pointer to the desired function, we recall first that if f is a pointer then *f is the thing that f points to (i.e. the function print in this case). As a result, just replace every occurrence of print in the loop above with *f:

void func ( void (*f)(int) ) {
  for ( int ctr = 0 ; ctr < 5 ; ctr++ ) {
    (*f)(ctr);
  }
}

Your gateway's IP address will appear in the second field of the line that starts either default or 0.0.0.0.

on Windows traceroute is actually tracert.exe, so there's no need for O/S dependencies in the code
it's a quick command to run - it gets information from the O/S, not from the network
traceroute is sometimes blocked by the network


The only downside is that it will be necessary to keep reading lines from the netstat output until the right line is found, since there'll be more than one line of output.

Your production code then initializes the service locator like this:

ServiceLocator::load(new ServiceLocator());


In your test-code, you insert your mock-settings like this:

ServiceLocator s = new ServiceLocator();
s->setGlobalSettings(new MockGlobalSettings());
ServiceLocator::load(s);

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/explain.html

That being said, once you are satisifed with your indexes and have exhausted all other avenues, de-normalization might be the right answer.  If you just have one or two queries that are problems, a manual approach is probably appropriate, whereas some sort of data warehousing tool might be better for creating a platform to develop data cubes.

Here's a site I found that touches on the subject:

http://www.meansandends.com/mysql-data-warehouse/?link_body%2Fbody=%7Bincl%3AAggregation%7D

Here's a simple technique that you can use to keep denormalizing queries simple, if you're just doing a few at a time (and I'm not replacing your OLTP tables, just creating a new one for reporting purposes).  Let's say you have this query in your application:

select a.name, b.address from tbla a 
join tblb b on b.fk_a_id = a.id where a.id=1


You could create a denormalized table and populate with almost the same query:

create table tbl_ab (a_id, a_name, b_address); 
-- (types elided)


Notice the underscores match the table aliases you use

insert tbl_ab select a.id, a.name, b.address from tbla a
join tblb b on b.fk_a_id = a.id 
-- no where clause because you want everything


Then to fix your app to use the new denormalized table, switch the dots for underscores.  

select a_name as name, b_address as address 
from tbl_ab where a_id = 1;


For huge queries this can save a lot of time and makes it clear where the data came from, and you can re-use the queries you already have.

Remember, I'm only advocating this as the last resort.  I bet there's a few indexes that would help you.  And when you de-normalize, don't forget to account for the extra space on your disks, and figure out when you will run the query to populate the new tables.  This should probably be at night, or whenever activity is low.  And the data in that table, of course, will never exactly be up to date.

[Yet another edit]  Don't forget that the new tables you create need to be indexed too!  The good part is that you can index to your heart's content and not worry about update lock contention, since aside from your bulk insert the table will only see selects.

Using out or ref passes a reference to the variable specified in the call to the function. Any changes to the value of an out or ref parameter will be passed back to the caller.

Both out and ref behave identically except for one slight difference: ref parameters are required to be initialised before calling, while out parameters can be uninitialised. By extension, ref parameters are guaranteed to be initialised at the start of the method, while out parameters are treated as uninitialised.

void Test2(ref string param)

    param = ""new value"";

For an example of how they've done interoperability, view their interoperability page.

Enough shilling. Generally speaking, I can summarize their general approach as:


Create issues in your bug tracker (ex: issue key of PROJ-123).
When you commit code, add ""PROJ-123"" to your commit comment to indicate what bug this code change fixes.
When your CI server checks out the code, scan the commit comments of the diffs. Record any strings matching the regex of your issue keys.
When the build completes, generate a report of what issue keys were found.


Specifically to your second problem:

Your CI doesn't doesn't have to put anything into your bug tracker. Bamboo doesn't put anything into JIRA. Instead, the Atlassian folks have provided a plugin to JIRA that will make a remote api call into Bamboo, asking the question ""Bamboo, to what builds am I (a JIRA issue) related?"". This is probably best explained with a screenshot.

Additionally, by having one 'authoritative' version of the source control, it becomes much easier to back up.

Centralized vs. distributed... the difference is really that in distributed, there isn't necessarily one 'authoritative' version of the source control, although in practice people usually still do have the master tree.

The big advantage to distributed source control is two-fold:


When you use distributed source control, you have the whole source tree on your local machine. You can commit, create branches, and work pretty much as though you were all alone, and then when you're ready to push up your changes, you can promote them from your machine to the master copy. If you're working ""offline"" a lot, this can be a huge benefit.
You don't have to ask anybody's permission to become a distributor of the source control. If person A is running the project, but person B and C want to make changes, and share those changes with each other, it becomes much easier with distributed source control.

""Black box"" testing is what most people think of when you mention Quality Assurance.

I work for a company where the QA team are also software developers.  (That narrows the field a lot if you care to guess the company.)  I know Joel's opinion, and my experience leads me to partially disagree: for the same reason that a ""white hat"" hacker is more effective finding security holes, certain kinds of errors are more effectively found by white box testers who know how to write code (and therefore what the common mistakes are - for example, resource management issues like memory leaks).  

Also, since QA-oriented developers are part of the process from the initial design phase, they can theoretically help to drive higher-quality code throughout the process.  Ideally, for each developer working on the project with a mental focus on functionality, you have an opposing developer with a mental focus on breaking the code (and thus making it better).  

Seen in that light, it's less a matter of using developers for testers than it is kind of disconnected pair-programming where one developer has an emphasis on controlling quality.  

On the other hand, a lot of testing (such as basic UI functionality) frankly doesn't need that kind of skill.  That's where Joel has a point. 

For many businesses, I could see a system where programming teams trade off code review and testing duties for each others' code.  Members of the Business Logic team, for example, could spend an occasional tour testing and reviewing code for the UI team, and vice-versa.  That way you're not ""wasting"" developer talent on full-time testing, but you are gaining the advantages of exposing the code to (hopefully) expert scrutiny and punishment.  Then, a more traditional QA team can take up the ""black box"" testing.

1207,28992,2069.0,2008-08-26T20:04:51Z,14530,165,"Some advantages of LINQ over sprocs:


Type safety: I think we all understand this.
Abstraction: This is especially true with LINQ-to-Entities.  This abstraction also allows the framework to add additional improvements that you can easily take advantage of.  PLINQ is an example of adding multi-threading support to LINQ.  Code changes are minimal to add this support.  It would be MUCH harder to do this data access code that simply calls sprocs.
Debugging support: I can use any .NET debugger to debug the queries.  With sprocs, you cannot easily debug the SQL and that experience is largely tied to your database vendor (MS SQL Server provides a query analyzer, but often that isn't enough).
Vendor agnostic: LINQ works with lots of databases and the number of supported databases will only increase.  Sprocs are not always portable between databases, either because of varying syntax or feature support (if the database supports sprocs at all).
Deployment: Others have mentioned this already, but it's easier to deploy a single assembly than to deploy a set of sprocs.  This also ties in with #4.
Easier: You don't have to learn T-SQL to do data access, nor do you have to learn the data access API (e.g. ADO.NET) necessary for calling the sprocs.  This is related to #3 and #4.


Some disadvantages of LINQ vs sprocs:


Network traffic: sprocs need only serialize sproc-name and argument data over the wire while LINQ sends the entire query.  This can get really bad if the queries are very complex.  However, LINQ's abstraction allows Microsoft to improve this over time.
Less flexible: Sprocs can take full advantage of a database's featureset.  LINQ tends to be more generic in it's support.  This is common in any kind of language abstraction (e.g. C# vs assembler).
Recompiling: If you need to make changes to the way you do data access, you need to recompile, version, and redeploy your assembly.  Sprocs can sometimes allow a DBA to tune the data access routine without a need to redeploy anything.


Security and manageability are something that people argue about too.


Security: For example, you can protect your sensitive data by restricting access to the tables directly, and put ACLs on the sprocs.  With LINQ, however, you can still restrict direct access  to tables and instead put ACLs on updatable table views to achieve a similar end (assuming your database supports updatable views).  
Manageability: Using views also gives you the advantage of shielding your application non-breaking from schema changes (like table normalization).  You can update the view without requiring your data access code to change.


I used to be a big sproc guy, but I'm starting to lean towards LINQ as a better alternative in general.  If there are some areas where sprocs are clearly better, then I'll probably still write a sproc but access it using LINQ. :)

I would recommend that you only retrieve the data when you are going to use it. If you are not going to need it, there is no reason to waste resources by retrieving it in Page_Load.

Asp.net handles connection pooling, and opens and closes connections in an efficient way. You shouldn't have to worry about this.

  Does anyone know of anyway to
  reduce/optimize the PDF export phase
  and or the size of the PDF without
  lowering the total page count?
  


I have a few ideas and questions:
1. Is this a graphics-heavy report?  If not, do you have tables that start out as text but are converted into a graphic by the SSRS PDF renderer (check if you can select the text in the PDF)?  41K per page might be more than it should be, or it might not, depending on how information-dense your report is.  But we've had cases where we had minor issues with a report's layout, like having a table bleed into the page's margins, that resulted in the SSRS PDF renderer ""throwing up its hands"" and rendering the table as an image instead of as text.  Obviously, the fewer graphics in your report, the smaller your file size will be.
2. Is there a way that you could easily break the report into pieces?  E.g., if it's a 10-location report, where Location 1 is followed by Location 2, etc., on your final report, could you run the Location 1 portion independent of the Location 2 portion, etc.?  If so, you could join the 10 sub-reports into one final PDF using PDFSharp after you've received them all.  This leads to some difficulties with page numbering, but nothing insurmountable.


  3. Does anyone else have any other
  theories as to why this runs on the
  server but not through the API?


My guess would be the sheer size of the report.  I don't remember everything about what's an IIS setting and what's SSRS-specific, but there might be some overall IIS settings (maybe in Metabase.xml) that you would have to be updated to even allow that much data to pass through. 

You could isolate the question of whether the time is the problem by taking one of your working reports and building in a long wait time in your stored procedures with WAITFOR (assuming SQL Server for your DBMS).

Not solutions, per se, but ideas.  Hope it helps.

If you put all your JS files into one directory, you can have your server-side environment (PHP for instance) loop through each file in that directory and output a <script src='/path/to/js/$file.js' type='text/javascript'> in some header file that is included by all your UI pages. You'll find this auto-loading especially handy if you're regularly creating and removing JS files.

When deploying to production, you should have a script that combines them all into one JS file and ""minifies"" it to keep the size down.

I tend to simplify this with:

public static T ParseEnum<T>(string value)

}


Then I can do:

StatusEnum MyStatus = EnumUtil.ParseEnum<StatusEnum>(""Active"");


One option suggested in the comments is to add an extension, which is simple enough:

public static T ToEnum<T>(this string value)
{
    return (T) Enum.Parse(typeof(T), value, true);
}

StatusEnum MyStatus = ""Active"".ToEnum<StatusEnum>();


Finally, you may want to have a default enum to use if the string cannot be parsed:

public static T ToEnum<T>(this string value, T defaultValue) 
{
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(value))
    {
        return defaultValue;

    T result;

StatusEnum MyStatus = ""Active"".ToEnum(StatusEnum.None);


However, I would be careful adding an extension method like this to string as (without namespace control) it will appear on all instances of string whether they hold an enum or not (so 1234.ToString().ToEnum(StatusEnum.None) would be valid but nonsensical) . It's often be best to avoid cluttering Microsoft's core classes with extra methods that only apply in very specific contexts unless your entire development team has a very good understanding of what those extensions do.

In its simplest form you make a single OSGi bundle out of your entire application. Clearly this is not a best practice but it can be useful to get a feel for deploying a bundle in an OSGi container (Equinox, Felix, Knoplerfish, etc).

To take it to the next level you'll want to start splitting your app into components, components should typically have a set of responsibilities that can be isolated from the rest of your application through a set of interfaces and class dependencies. Identifying these purely by hand can range from rather straightforward for a well designed highly cohesive but loosely coupled application to a nightmare for interlocked source code that you are not familiar with.

Some help can come from tools like JDepend which can show you the coupling of Java packages against other packages/classes in your system. A package with low efferent coupling should be easier to extract into an OSGi bundle than one with high efferent coupling. Even more architectural insight can be had with pro tools like Structure 101.

Purely on a technical level, working daily with an application that consists of 160 OSGi bundles and using Spring DM I can confirm that the transition from ""normal"" Spring to Spring DM is largely pain free. The extra namespace and the fact that you can (and should) isolate your OSGi specific Spring configuration in separate files makes it even easier to have both with and without OSGi deployment scenarios.

OSGi is a deep and wide component model, documentation I recommend:


OSGi R4 Specification: Get the PDFs of the Core and Compendium specification, they are canonical, authoritative and very readable. Have a shortcut to them handy at all times, you will consult them.
Read up on OSGi best practices, there is a large set of things you can do but a somewhat smaller set of things you should do and there are some things you should never do (DynamicImport: * for example).

There are plenty of criticisms of Active Record.  You can especially run into problems where you are querying the database for each record or your classes are tightly coupled to your database, creating inflexibility in both.  In that case you can move up a level and go with something like DataMapper. 

Many of the modern frameworks and ORM's are aware of some of these drawbacks and provide solutions for them.  Do a little research and you will start to see that this is a problem that has a number of solutions and it all depend on your needs.

How long do you expect the data to be? How random? If lengths vary greatly (say for files) then just return the length.  If lengths are likely to be similar look at a subset of the bytes that varies.

GetHashCode should be a lot quicker than Equals, but doesn't need to be unique.

What we found was that in a heavy load situation, it was fairly easy for the remote server to time out connections at the TCP layer simply because the server was busy.  Part of the reason was the defaults for how many times TCP will retransmit data on Windows weren't appropriate for our situation.

Take a look at the registry settings for tuning TCP/IP on Windows.  In particular you want to look at TcpMaxDataRetransmissions and maybe TcpMaxConnectRetransmissions.  These default to 5 and 2 respectively, try upping them a little bit on the client system and duplicate the load situation.

Don't go crazy!  TCP doubles the timeout with each successive retransmission, so the timeout behavior for bad connections can go exponential on you if you increase these too much.  As I recall upping TcpMaxDataRetransmissions to 6 or 7 solved our problem in the vast majority of cases.

341536,5917133,83805.0,2011-05-06T21:20:55Z,16770,87,"Haskell's algebraic data types are named such since they correspond to an initial algebra in category theory, giving us some laws, some operations and some symbols to manipulate. We may even use algebraic notation for describing regular data structures, where:


+ represents sum types (disjoint unions, e.g. Either).
â¢ represents product types (e.g. structs or tuples)
X for the singleton type (e.g. data X a = X a)
1 for the unit type ()
and Î¼ for the least fixed point (e.g. recursive types), usually implicit.


with some additional notation:


XÂ² for Xâ¢X


In fact, you might say (following Brent Yorgey) that a Haskell data type is regular if it can be expressed in terms of 1, X, +, â¢, and a least ï¬xed point.

With this notation, we can concisely describe many regular data structures:


Units: data () = ()

1
Options: data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a

1 + X
Lists: data [a] = [] | a : [a]

L = 1+Xâ¢L
Binary trees: data BTree a = Empty | Node a (BTree a) (BTree a)

B = 1 + Xâ¢BÂ²


Other operations hold (taken from Brent Yorgey's paper, listed in the references):


Expansion: unfolding the fix point can be helpful for thinking about lists. L = 1 + X + XÂ² + XÂ³ + ... (that is, lists are either empty, or they have one element, or two elements, or three, or ...)
Composition, â¦, given types F and G, the composition F â¦ G is a type which builds âF-structures made out of G-structuresâ (e.g. R = X â¢ (L â¦ R) ,where L is lists, is a rose tree.
Differentiation, the derivative of a data type D (given as D') is the type of D-structures with a single âholeâ, that is, a distinguished location not containing any data. That amazingly satisfy the same rules as for differentiation in calculus:

1â² = 0

Xâ² = 1

(F + G)â² = F' + Gâ²

(F â¢ G)â² = F â¢ Gâ² + Fâ² â¢ G

(F â¦ G)â² = (Fâ² â¦ G) â¢ Gâ²

So when writing a function or method that takes a collection, write it not to take a List, but an IList<T>, an ICollection<T>, or IEnumerable<T>.  The generic interfaces will still work even for heterogenous lists because System.Object can be a T too.  Doing this will save you headache if you decide to use a Stack or some other data structure further down the road.  If all you need to do in the function is foreach through it, IEnumerable<T> is really all you should be asking for.

Identify the OpenGL extension and the extension APIs you wish to use. OpenGL extensions are listed in the OpenGL Extension Registry.

Check if your graphic card supports the extensions you wish to use. Download and install the latest drivers and SDKs for your graphics card.

Recent versions of NVIDIA OpenGL SDK ship with GLEW. If you're using this, then you don't need to do some of the following steps.

Download GLEW and unzip it.

Add the GLEW bin path to your Windows PATH environment variable. Alternatively, you can also place the glew32.dll in a directory where Windows picks up its DLLs.

Add the GLEW include path to your compiler's include directory list.

Add the GLEW lib path to your compiler's library directory list.

Instruct your compiler to use glew32.lib during linking. If you're using Visual C++ compilers then one way to do this is by adding the following line to your code:

#pragma comment(lib, ""glew32.lib"")


Add a #include <GL/glew.h> line to your code. Ensure that this is placed above the includes of other GL header files. (You may actually not need the GL header files includes if you include glew.h.)

Initialize GLEW using glewInit() after you've initialized GLUT or GL. If it fails, then something is wrong with your setup.

if (GLEW_OK != glewInit())
{
    // GLEW failed!
    exit(1);
}


Check if the extension(s) you wish to use are now available through GLEW. You do this by checking a boolean variable named GLEW_your_extension_name which is exposed by GLEW.


  Example:


if (!GLEW_EXT_framebuffer_object)
{
    exit(1);
}


That's it! You can now use the OpenGL extension calls in your code just as if they existed naturally for Windows.

Basically in a simple form it's %[width].[precision][type]. Width allows you to make sure that the variable which is being printed is at least a certain length (useful for tables etc). Precision allows you to specify the precision a number is printed to (eg. decimal places etc) and the informs C/C++ what the variable you've given it is (character, integer, double etc).

Hope this helps

To clarify using your examples:

printf( ""%10.1f     %10.2\n"", radius, area );


%10.1f (referring to the first argument: radius) means make it 10 characters long (ie. pad with spaces), and print it as a float with one decimal place.

4766,93952,16929.0,2008-09-18T16:05:56Z,18450,393,"There are a couple of scenarios to consider: (a) if you are porting an existing application and wondering if Mono is good enough for this task;   (b) you are starting to write some new code, and you want to know if Mono is mature enough.

For the first case, you can use the Mono Migration Analyzer tool (Moma) to evaluate how far your application is from running on Mono.  If the evaluation comes back with flying colors, you should start on your testing and QA and get ready to ship.

If your evaluation comes back with a report highlighting features that are missing or differ significantly in their semantics in Mono you will have to evaluate whether the code can be adapted, rewritten or in the worst case whether your application can work with reduced functionality.      

According to our Moma statistics based on user submissions (this is from memory) about 50% of the applications work out of the box, about 25% require about a week worth of work (refactoring, adapting) another 15% require a serious commitment to redo chunks of your code, and the rest is just not worth bothering porting since they are so incredibly tied to Win32.   At that point, either you start from zero, or a business decision will drive the effort to make your code portable, but we are talking months worth of work (at least from the reports we have).

If you are starting from scratch, the situation is a lot simpler, because you will only be using the APIs that are present in Mono.   As long as you stay with the supported stack (which is pretty much .NET 2.0, plus all the core upgrades in 3.5 including LINQ and System.Core, plus any of the Mono cross-platform APIs) you will be fine.  

Every once in a while you might run into bugs in Mono or limitations, and you might have to work around them, but that is not different than any other system.

As for portability: ASP.NET applications are the easier ones to port, as those have little to no dependencies on Win32 and you can even use SQL server or other popular databases (there are plenty of bundled database providers with Mono).   

Windows.Forms porting is sometimes trickier because developers like to escape the .NET sandbox and P/Invoke their brains out to configure things as useful as the changing the cursor blinking rate expressed as two bezier points encoded in BCD form in a wParam.   Or some junk like that.

  I want to add a rule that checks for
  the presence of a folder.jpg file in
  each directory, but to add this would
  make the code substantially more messy
  in it's current state..


This doesn't look bad.  In fact your current code does it very nicely, and Sven mentioned a good way to do it as well:


Get a list of all the files
Check for ""required"" files


You would just have have add to your dictionary a list of required files:

checker = {
  ...
  'required': ['file', 'list', 'for_required']
}


As far as there being a better/extensible way to do this?  I am not exactly sure.  I could only really think of a way to possibly drop the ""multiple"" regular expressions and build off of Sven's idea for using a delimiter.  So my strategy would be defining a dictionary as follows (and I'm sorry I don't know Python syntax and I'm a tad to lazy to look it up but it should make sense.  The /regex/ is shorthand for a regex):

check_dict = {
  'delim'    : /\-/,
  'parts'    : [ 'Show Name', 'Episode Name', 'Episode Number' ],
  'patterns' : [/valid name/, /valid episode name/, /valid number/ ],
  'required' : ['list', 'of', 'files'],
  'ignored'  : ['.*', 'hidden.txt'],
  'start_dir': '/path/to/dir/to/test/'
}



Split the filename based on the delimiter.
Check each of the parts.


Because its an ordered list you can determine what parts are missing and if a section doesn't match any pattern it is malformed.  Here the parts and patterns have a 1 to 1 ratio.  Two arrays instead of a dictionary enforces the order.

Ignored and required files can be listed.  The . and .. files should probably be ignored automatically.  The user should be allowed to input ""globs"" which can be shell expanded.  I'm thinking here of svn:ignore properties, but globbing is natural for listing files.

Here start_dir would be default to the current directory but if you wanted a single file to run automated testing of a bunch of directories this would be useful.

The real loose end here is the path template and along the same lines what path is required for ""valid files"".  I really couldn't come up with a solid idea without writing one large regular expression and taking groups from it... to build a template.  It felt a lot like writing a TextMate language grammar.  But that starts to stray on the ease of use.  The real problem was that the path template was not composed of parts, which makes sense but adds complexity.

Is this strategy in tune with what you were thinking of?

The good news is that Xcode 3 and later come with superb auto-completion and template support.  By default, you have to explicitly request completion by hitting the escape key.  (This actually works in all NSTextViews; try it!)  If you want to have the completions appear automatically, you can go to Preferences -> Code Sense and set the pop-up to appear automatically after a few seconds.  You should find good completions for C and Objective-C code, and pretty good completions for C++.

Xcode also has a solid template/skeleton system that you can use.  You can see what templates are available by default by going to Edit -> Insert Text Macro.  Of course, you don't want to insert text macros with the mouse; that defeats the point.  Instead, you have two options:


Back in Preferences,go to Key Bindings, and then, under Menu Key Bindings, assign a specific shortcut to macros you use often.  I personally don't bother doing this, but I know plenty of great Mac devs who do
Use the CompletionPrefix.  By default, nearly all of the templates have a special prefix that, if you type and then hit the escape key, will result in the template being inserted.  You can use Control-/ to move between the completion fields.

You can see a full list of Xcode's default macros and their associated CompletionPrefixes at Crooked Spin.

You can also add your own macros, or modify the defaults.  To do so, edit the file /Developer/Library/Xcode/Specifications/{C,HTML}.xctxtmacro.  The syntax should be self-explanatory, if not terribly friendly.


Unfortunately, if you're addicted to R#, you will be disappointed by your refactoring options.  Basic refactoring is provided within Xcode through the context menu or by hitting Shift-Apple-J.  From there, you can extract and rename methods, promote and demote them through the class hierarchy, and a few other common operations.  Unfortunately, neither Xcode nor any third-party utilities offer anything approaching Resharper, so on that front, you're currently out of luck.  Thankfully, Apple has already demonstrated versions of Xcode in the works that have vastly improved refactoring capabilities, so hopefully you won't have to wait too long before the situation starts to improve.

There's an obvious balance on when to use Silverlight vs. Flash when you're concerned about reach and install base, but here are some reasons Silverlight is a good direction to move in:


Second mover advantage - Just as Microsoft built a ""better Java"" with .NET, they're able to look at how you'd design a RIA plugin from scratch, today. They have the advantage of knowing how people use the web today, something the inventors of Flash could never have accurately guessed. Flash can add features, but they can't realistically chuck the platform and start over.
Developer familiarity - While Silverlight is a new model, it's not entirely unfamiliar to developers. They'll ""get"" the way Silverlight works a lot more quickly than they'll understand firing up a new development environment with a new scripting language and new event paradigms.
Being rid of the timeline model in Flash - Flash was originally built for keyframe based animations, and while there are ways to abstract this away, it's at the core of how Flash works. Silverlight ditches that for an application-centric model. 
ScottGu - ScottGu is fired up about Silverlight. Nuff said.
Cool new features - While Silverlight still has some catching up to do with Flash on some obvious features (like webcam / mic integration, or 3d / graphics acceleration), there are some slick new technologies built in to Silverlight - Deep Zoom is one example. I'm seeing more ""revolutionary"" technologies on the Silverlight side, while Flash seems to be in maintenance mode at this point.

847,21967,1630.0,2008-08-22T09:13:56Z,21560,3,"I finally got Multisampling working with my wxWidgets OpenGL program. It's a bit messy right now, but here's how:

wxWidgets doesn't have Multisampling support in their stable releases right now (latest version at this time is 2.8.8). But, it's available as a patch and also through their daily snapshot. (The latter is heartening, since it means that the patch has been accepted and should appear in later stable releases if there are no issues.)

So, there are 2 options:


Download and build from their daily snapshot.
Get the patch for your working wxWidgets installation.


I found the 2nd option to be less cumbersome, since I don't want to disturb my working installation as much as possible. If you don't know how to patch on Windows, see this.

At the very least, for Windows, the patch will modify the following files:

$(WX_WIDGETS_ROOT)/include/wx/glcanvas.h
$(WX_WIDGETS_ROOT)/include/wx/msw/glcanvas.h
$(WX_WIDGETS_ROOT)/src/msw/glcanvas.cpp


After patching, recompile the wxWidgets libraries.

To enable multisampling in your wxWidgets OpenGL program, minor changes to the code are required.

An attribute list needs to be passed to the wxGLCanvas constructor:

int attribList[] = {WX_GL_RGBA,
                    WX_GL_DOUBLEBUFFER,
                    WX_GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS, GL_TRUE, // Multi-sampling
                    WX_GL_DEPTH_SIZE, 16,
                    0, 0};


If you were already using an attribute list, then add the line with GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS, GL_TRUE to it. Else, add this attribute list definition to your code.

Then modify your wxGLCanvas constructor to take this attribute list as a parameter:

myGLFrame::myGLFrame    // Derived from wxGLCanvas
(
    wxWindow *parent,
    wxWindowID id,
    const wxPoint& pos,
    const wxSize& size,
    long style,
    const wxString& name
)
: wxGLCanvas(parent, (wxGLCanvas*) NULL, id, pos, size, style, name, attribList)
{
    // ...
}


After the wxGLCanvas element is created, multisampling is turned on by default. To disable or enable it at will, use the related OpenGL calls:

glEnable(GL_MULTISAMPLE);
glDisable(GL_MULTISAMPLE);


Multisampling should now work with the wxWidgets OpenGL program. Hopefully, it should be supported in the stable release of wxWidgets soon, making this information irrelevant :-)

MemCached Win32
Velocity
.net Cache
Enterprise Library Caching Application Block

MemCached Win32: Up until recently I have used MemCached Win32.  This is a akin to a web farm (many servers serving the same content for high availability) but it is a cache farm.  This means that you can install it locally on your web server initially if you don't have the resources to go bigger.  Then as you go down the road you can scale horizontally (more servers) or vertically (more hardware).  This is a product that was ported from the original MemCached to work on Windows.  This product has been used extensively in very high traffic sites.  http://lineofthought.com/tools/memcached

Velocity: This is Microsofts answer to products such as MemCached.  MemCached has been out for quite some time, Velocity is in CTP mode.  I must say that from what I have read so far this product will certainly turn my head once it is out.  But I can't bring myself to run big production projects on a CTP product with zero track record.  I have started playing with it though as once it gains momentum MemCached won't even compare for those locked in the windows world!  http://blogs.msdn.com/velocity/

.NET Cache:  There is no reason to discount the standard .NET Cache.  It is built in and ready to use for free and with no (major) set up required.  It offers flexibility by way of offering mechanisms for storing items in local memory, a SINGLE state server, or a centralized database.  Where Velocity steps in is when you need more than a single state server (cache in memory) and don't want to use a slow database for holding your cache.

Enterprise Application Block: I stay away from all of the Enterprise Application Blocks.  They are heavy frameworks that give more than I generally require!  As long as you remember to wrap everything that touches code that is not your own and follow simple rules for coding, stick to any of the other methods over this one!  (just my opinion of course - MySpace leverages as much as they can out of Enterprise Application Blocks!)

You don't have to choose up front!  I generally create a cache wrapper that I communicate with in my code for methods such as Get, Set, Exists, Remove, ListKeys, etc.  This then points to an underlying level of cache abstraction that can point to MemCached, Velocity, or .NET cache.  I use StructureMap (or choose another IoC container) to inject which form of cache I want to use for a given environment.  In my local dev box I might use .NET cache in the session.  In production I generally use MemCached Win 32.  But regardless of how it is set up you can easily swap things around to try each system out to see what works best for you.  You just need to make sure that you application knows as little as possible about how things are cached!  Once this layer of abstraction is in place you can then do things such as run a compression algorithm (gzip) for all the data that is going in and out of cache which would allow you to store 10 times the amount of data in cache. - transparently.

I cover .NET Cache, MemCached Win32, StructureMap, and the appropriate abstractions in my book if you are interested!

GenuineChannels. It uses remoting with a lot of nice added features, the most important one being it works through NATs without the need to open the client firewall. Unfortunately seems to be very dead.

Another solution is to use streaming with IIS, according to this article: Keeping connections open in IIS

The client makes the first connection (http with IIS6, tcp with IIS7) to the server at port 80, the connection is then kept open with a streaming response that never ends.

I haven't had the time to experiment with this, and I haven't found a sample that says it specifically solves the firewall-problem, but here's an excellent sample that probably works: Streaming XML.

The only real solution is HTTPS. If you don't want to do SSL on your whole site (maybe you have performance concerns), you might be able to get away with only SSL protecting the sensitive areas. To do that, first make sure your login page is HTTPS. When a user logs in, set a secure cookie (meaning the browser will only transmit it over an SSL link) in addition to the regular session cookie. Then, when a user visits one of your ""sensitive"" areas, redirect them to HTTPS, and check for the presence of that secure cookie. A real user will have it, a session hijacker will not.

I actually think this is an interesting question. I'm not sure how useful it is, but it is a valid question.

@Ed

Can you provide a little more info on this question? You said the dimension of the array is dynamic, but is the number of elements dynamic as well?

EDIT: I'm going to try and answer the question anyways. I can't give you the code off the top of my head (it would take a while to get it right without any compiler here on this PC), but I can point you in the right direction ...

Let's use 8 dimensions (0-7) with indexes 0 to 3 as an example. You care about only 1,2 and 6. This means you have two arrays. First, array_care[4][4][4] for 1,2, and 6. The array_care[4][4][4] will hold the end result.

Next, we want to iterate in a very specific way. We have the array input[4][4][4][4][4][4][4][4] to parse through, and we care about dimensions 1, 2, and 6.

We need to define some temporary indexes:

int dim[8] = {0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0};


We also need to store the order in which we want to increase the indexes:

int increase_index_order[8] = {7,5,4,3,0,6,2,1};
int i = 0;


This order is important for doing what you requested.

Define a termination flag:

bool terminate=false;


Now we can create our loop:

while (terminate)
{
array_care[dim[1]][dim[2]][dim[6]] += input[dim[0]][dim[1]][dim[2]][dim[3]][dim[4]][dim[5]][dim[6]][dim[7]];

while ((dim[increase_index_order[i]] = 3) && (i < 8))
{
dim[increase_index_order[i]]=0;
i++;
}

if (i < 8) {
dim[increase_index_order[i]]++; i=0;
} else {
terminate=true;
}
}


That should work for 8 dimensions, caring about 3 dimensions. It would take a bit more time to make it dynamic, and I don't have the time. Hope this helps. I apologize, but I haven't learned the code markups yet. :(

Seriously.

Look at the things that are important: your project, your code, your job, your personal life. None of them are going to have their success rest on whether or not you use the ""this"" keyword to qualify access to fields. The this keyword will not help you ship on time. It's not going to reduce bugs, it's not going to have any appreciable effect on code quality or maintainability. It's not going to get you a raise, or allow you to spend less time at the office. 

It's really just a style issue. If you like ""this"", then use it. If you don't, then don't. If you need it to get correct semantics then use it. The truth is, every programmer has his own unique programing style. That style reflects that particular programmer's notions of what the ""most aesthetically pleasing code"" should look like. By definition, any other programmer who reads your code is going to have a different programing style. That means there is always going to be something you did that the other guy doesn't like, or would have done differently. At some point some guy is going to read your code and grumble about something. 

I wouldn't fret over it. I would just make sure the code is as aesthetically pleasing as possible according to your own tastes. If you ask 10 programmers how to format code, you are going to get about 15 different opinions. A better thing to focus on is how the code is factored. Are things abstracted right? Did I pick meaningful names for things? Is there a lot of code duplication? Are there ways I can simplify stuff? Getting those things right, I think, will have the greatest positive impact on your project, your code, your job, and your life. Coincidentally, it will probably also cause the other guy to grumble the least. If your code works, is easy to read, and is well factored, the other guy isn't going to be scrutinizing how you initialize fields. He's just going to use your code, marvel at it's greatness, and then move on to something else.

So, I wrote a polyglot which works in the three languages I often write in, as well as one from my other answer to this question and one I just learned today.  It's a standalone program, which reads a single line containing a nonnegative integer and prints a single line containing its factorial.  Bignums are used in all languages, so the maximum computable factorial depends only on your computer's resources.


Perl: uses built-in bignum package.  Run with perl FILENAME.
Haskell: uses built-in bignums.  Run with runhugs FILENAME or your favorite compiler's equivalent.
C++: requires GMP for bignum support.  To compile with g++, use g++ -lgmpxx -lgmp -x c++ FILENAME to link against the right libraries.  After compiling, run ./a.out.  Or use your favorite compiler's equivalent.
brainf*ck: I wrote some bignum support in this post.  Using Muller's classic distribution, compile with bf < FILENAME > EXECUTABLE.  Make the output executable and run it.  Or use your favorite distribution.
Whitespace: uses built-in bignum support.  Run with wspace FILENAME.


Edit: added Whitespace as a fifth language.  Incidentally, do not wrap the code with <code> tags; it breaks the Whitespace.  Also, the code looks much nicer in fixed-width.

Bear in mind that classes provide the advantage of methods and access control, as well. So if you wanted to ensure that people weren't changing weights to negative numbers, you could make the weight field private and provide some accessor methods, like getWeight() and setWeight(). Inside setWeight(), you could do some value checking, like so:

public function setWeight($weight)

  The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed


While this is true and has been observed by other people (take Stepanov, inventor of the STL), the rest is nonsense. OOP may be flawed and it certainly is no silver bullet but it makes large-scale applications much simpler because it's a great way to reduce dependencies. Of course, this is only true for âgoodâ OOP design. Sloppy design won't give any advantage. But good, decoupled design can be modelled very well using OOP and not well using other techniques.

There are much better, more universal models (Haskell's type model comes to mind) but these are also often more complicated and/or difficult to implement efficiently. OOP is a good trade-off between extremes.

The biggest change you will find migrating to SVN is the idea of ""Check out"" and ""Check in"" aren't exactly the same as ""Update"" and ""Commit"". . . thus, any IDE integration with VB6 is limited because VB6 supports MSSCCI, a check-out/check-in mechanism.  I once used TamTam SVN (http://www.daveswebsite.com/software/tamtamsvn/index.shtml) with Visual Studio 2003, but stopped since I found it limiting.  Merging/branching/blaming, etc. are very powerful features Tortoise SVN provides that weren't in TamTam. Tigris also has http://svnvb6.tigris.org/, but I have not tried it.

Again, while you quite possibly get an IDE to work with VB6, I would not recommend it since the greatest strength of migrating to SVN is to break the Source Safe philosophy of check-in/check-out.

It can be a confusing language to learn, but if you read enough about it and practice, eventually you'll learn the best way to do things.

Great x-platform support - I've used it on Windows and Linux, and found it easy on both
Solid Documentation - The docs are clear and to the point, with great examples
Deep per-platform support - There are some unique features in the window service management system that are supported perfectly by service wrapper (w/o restarting).  And on Windows, you will even see your app name in the process list instead of just ""java.exe"".
Standards Compliant - Unlike many ad-hoc Java init scripts, the scripts for service wrapper tend to be compliant with LSB standards.  This can end up being very important if you ever want high availability management from something like Linux Heartbeat/HA.

  Are screen readers really so primitive that they would read text that isn't even displayed on the screen?


What you have to remember is that any HTML parser doesn't read the screen - it reads the source markup. Whta you see on the screen is the browser's attempt to apply CSS to the source code. It's irrelevant.


  You could probably even identify parts of the page that are menus or table of contents, and give some sort of easy way for those parts to be read exclusively or skipped over.


You could, if there were a standard for such a thing.

I'm not very hot on the limitations of screen readers, however I've read a lot about them not being ideal. The best thing I can reccommend is to put your source in order - how you'd read it.

To answer the original question, one way you could do this, and mind you, this is a bit of a hack, simply serialize the two arrays to JSON and then compare the two JSON strings. That would simply tell you if the arrays are different, obviously you could do this to each of the objects within the arrays as well to see which ones were different.

Another option is to use a library which has some nice facilities for comparing objects - I use and recommend MochiKit.



EDIT: The answer kamens gave deserves consideration as well, since a single function to compare two given objects would be much smaller than any library to do what I suggest (although my suggestion would certainly work well enough).

Here is a naÃ¯ve implemenation that may do just enough for you - be aware that there are potential problems with this implementation:

function objectsAreSame(x, y) {
   var objectsAreSame = true;
   for(var propertyName in x) {

  Is there a way to open file in a non-exclusive way,


Yes, using Win32, passing the various FILE_SHARE_Xxxx flags to CreateFile.


  is it cross platform?


No, it requires platform-specific code.

Due to annoying backwards compatibility concerns (DOS applications, being single-tasking, assume that nothing can delete a file out from under them, i.e. that they can fclose() and then fopen() without anything going amiss; Win16 preserved this assumption to make porting DOS applications easier, Win32 preserved this assumption to make porting Win16 applications easier, and it's awful), Windows defaults to opening files exclusively.

The underlying OS infrastructure supports deleting/renaming open files  (although I believe it does have the restriction that memory-mapped files cannot be deleted, which I think isn't a restriction found on *nix), but the default opening semantics do not.

C++ has no notion of any of this; the C++ operating environment is much the same as the DOS operating environment--no other applications running concurrently, so no need to control file sharing.

  The DOI prefix shall be composed of a directory indicator followed by
  a registrant code. These two components shall be separated by a full
  stop (period).
  
  The directory indicator shall be ""10"". The directory indicator
  distinguishes the entire set of character strings (prefix and suffix)
  as digital object identifiers within the resolution system.


Easy enough, the initial \b prevents us from ""matching"" a ""DOI"" that doesn't start with 10.:

$pattern = '\b(10[.]';





  The second element of the DOI prefix shall be the registrant code. The
  registrant code is a unique string assigned to a registrant.


Also, all assigned registrant code are numeric, and at least 4 digits long, so:

$pattern = '\b(10[.][0-9]{4,}';





  The registrant code may be further divided into sub-elements for
  administrative convenience if desired. Each sub-element of the
  registrant code shall be preceded by a full stop.


$pattern = '\b(10[.][0-9]{4,}(?:[.][0-9]+)*';





  The DOI syntax shall be made up of a DOI prefix and a DOI suffix
  separated by a forward slash.


However, this isn't absolutely necessary, section 2.2.3 states that uncommon suffix systems may use other conventions (such as 10.1000.123456 instead of 10.1000/123456), but lets cut some slack.

$pattern = '\b(10[.][0-9]{4,}(?:[.][0-9]+)*/';





  The DOI name is case-insensitive and can incorporate any printable
  characters from the legal graphic characters of Unicode. The DOI
  suffix shall consist of a character string of any length chosen by the
  registrant. Each suffix shall be unique to the prefix element that
  precedes it. The unique suffix can be a sequential number, or it might
  incorporate an identifier generated from or based on another system.


Now this is where it gets trickier, from all the DOIs I have processed, I saw the following characters (besides [0-9a-zA-Z] of course) in their suffixes: .-()/:- -- so, while it doesn't exist, the DOI 10.1016.12.31/nature.S0735-1097(98)2000/12/31/34:7-7 is completely plausible.

The logical choice would be to use \S or the [[:graph:]] PCRE POSIX class, so lets do that:

$pattern = '\b(10[.][0-9]{4,}(?:[.][0-9]+)*/\S+'; // or
$pattern = '\b(10[.][0-9]{4,}(?:[.][0-9]+)*/[[:graph:]]+';




Now we have a difficult problem, the [[:graph:]] class is a super-set of the [[:punct:]] class, which includes characters easily found in free text or any markup language: ""'&<> among others.

Lets just filter the markup ones for now using a negative lookahead:

$pattern = '\b(10[.][0-9]{4,}(?:[.][0-9]+)*/(?:(?![""&\'<>])\S)+'; // or
$pattern = '\b(10[.][0-9]{4,}(?:[.][0-9]+)*/(?:(?![""&\'<>])[[:graph:]])+';




The above should cover encoded entities (&), attribute quotes ([""']) and open / close tags ([<>]).

Unlike markup languages, free text usually doesn't employ punctuation characters unless they are bounded by at least one space or placed at the end of a sentence, for instance:


  This is a long DOI:
  10.1016.12.31/nature.S0735-1097(98)2000/12/31/34:7-7!!!


The solution here is to close our capture group and assert another word boundary:

$pattern = '\b(10[.][0-9]{4,}(?:[.][0-9]+)*/(?:(?![""&\'<>])\S)+)\b'; // or
$pattern = '\b(10[.][0-9]{4,}(?:[.][0-9]+)*/(?:(?![""&\'<>])[[:graph:]])+)\b';

But having played with sources following the philosophy ""let's put together everything"", the conclusion is that only the one who wrote the file has any hope to not be lost inside. Even with an IDE, it is easy to miss things because when you're playing with a source of 20,000 lines, you just close your mind for anything not exactly refering to your problem.

Real life example: the class hierarchy defined in those thousand lines sources closed itself into a diamond-inheritance, and some methods were overridden in child classes by methods with exactly the same code. This was easily overlooked (who wants to explore/check a 20,000 lines source code?), and when the original method was changed (bug correction), the effect was not as universal as excepted.

Dependancies becoming circular?

I had this problem with templated code, but I saw similar problems with regular C++ and C code.

Breaking down your sources into 1 header per struct/class lets you:


Speed up compilation because you can use symbol forward-declaration instead of including whole objects
Have circular dependencies between classes (Â§) (i.e. class A has a pointer to B, and B has a pointer to A)


In source-controlled code, class dependencies could lead to regular moving of classes up and down the file, just to make the header compile. You don't want to study the evolution of such moves when comparing the same file in different versions.

Having separate headers makes the code more modular, faster to compile, and makes it easier to study its evolution through different versions diffs

For my template program, I had to divide my headers into two files: The .HPP file containing the template class declaration/definition, and the .INL file containing the definitions of the said class methods.

Putting all this code inside one and only one unique header would mean putting class definitions at the begining of this file, and the method definitions at the end.

And then, if someone needed only a small part of the code, with the one-header-only solution, they still would have to pay for the slower compilation.

(Â§) Note that you can have circular dependencies between classes if you know which class owns which. This is a discussion about classes having knowledge of the existence of other classes, not shared_ptr circular dependencies antipattern.

One last word: Headers should be self-sufficients

One thing, though, that must be respected by a solution of multiple headers and multiple sources.

When you include one header, no matter which header, your source must compile cleanly.

Each header should be self-sufficient. You're supposed to develop code, not treasure-hunting by greping your 10,000+ source files project to find which header defines the symbol in the 1,000 lines header you need to include just because of one enum.

This means that either each header defines or forward-declare all the symbols it uses, or include all the needed headers (and only the needed headers).

âCopy leftâ is the philosophy of the free software foundation requiring anything incorporating the licensed opens source code to also be licensed as open source.  That philosophy is regarded as poison by established companies that want to keep their products proprietary.

Aside from not having âcopy leftâ provisions, the Apache license specifically addresses the grant of rights from project contributors and it expressly addresses the fact that modern companies are typically made up for more than one legal entity (for example, a parent company and its subsidiaries).  Most open source licenses donât address these points.

Whatever license you choose, if you want your code to be âcorporate friendly,â in the sense that you want it to be incorporated into commercial, non-open source products, it is essential that you avoid GPL and other âcopy leftâ type licenses.  While it would be best to consult with your own lawyer before investing time or money in a project for which this is an important factor, a quick shorthand for licenses that are and are not âcopy leftâ can be found on the Free Software Foundationâs website.  They identify which licenses they donât find meet their standards as âcopy left.â  The ones FSF rejects are most likely the ones that will be corporate friendly in this sense.

(Although the question didnât ask this, it is worth mentioning that, with very few exceptions, even GPL and other âcopy leftâ type licenses are perfectly corporate friendly if they are only used internally by the commercial entities and not incorporated into their products.)

Additionally, throwing a ton of extra connections at the DB doesn't help anything unless there are resources on the DB server sitting idle.  If you've got 8 cores and only one is being used to satisfy a query, then sure, making another connection might help.  More likely, though, you are already using all the available cores.  You're also likely hitting the same harddrive for every DB request, and adding additional lock contention.

If your DB has anything resembling high utilization, adding extra connections won't help.  That'd be like spawning extra threads in an application with the blind hope that the extra concurrency will make processing faster.  It might in some certain circumstances, but in other cases it'll just slow you down as you thrash the hard drive, waste time task-switching, and introduce synchronization overhead.

For some reason MS has never seen the need for it.  For example, even though you can actually get a command console on WM, it does not support running batch files, even though all the commands are still there and it would be relatively easy.  There is definitely not a VBScript engine I've ever heard of nor JScript.  There is PythonCE but the WM specific support is minimal and you don't get access to a lot of WM only things.

Also, I've done a lot of work with a company called SOTI which has a product called MobiControl that does incorporate a basic scripting engine. Though most of the commands are specific to their system and actually have to be run from a desktop-side management console.

I'm not sure if I understand the question description correctly, but I think you are trying to wrap the NTLM authentication for SharePoint, which means you don't have control over the server-side authentication protocol, correct? If you're not able to manipulate the server side to avoid sending a 401 response on failed credentials, then you will not be able to avoid this problem, because it's part of the (client-side) spec:

The XMLHttpRequest Object


  If the UA supports HTTP Authentication [RFC2617] it SHOULD consider requests
  originating from this object to be part of the protection space that includes the
  accessed URIs and send Authorization  headers and handle 401 Unauthorised requests
  appropriately. if authentication fails, UAs should prompt the users for credentials.


So the spec actually calls for the browser to prompt the user accordingly if any 401 response is received in an XMLHttpRequest, just as if the user had accessed the URL directly. As far as I can tell the only way to really avoid this would be for you to have control over the server side and cause 401 Unauthorized responses to be avoided, as Mark mentioned. 

One last thought is that you may be able to get around this using a proxy, such a separate server side script on another webserver. That script then takes a user and pass parameter and checks the authentication, so that the user's browser isn't what's making the original HTTP request and therefore isn't receiving the 401 response that's causing the prompt. If you do it this way you can find out from your ""proxy"" script if it failed, and if so then prompt the user again until it succeeds. On a successful authentication event, you can simply fetch the HTTP request as you are now, since everything works if the credentials are correctly specified.

How you test/launch depends mostly on:


What your application is.
Who your users are.


If you application is a technical application and is geared to the technically-minded, the word ""beta"" won't really scare them - but provide an opportunity to test the product before it goes 'live', and help to improve the system.  This is the ideal circumstance in which to use either an open or closed beta.  It's usually beneficial to start off 'closed' with a group of people you select and trust to bug-find quickly and reliably - after you're more confident that all the critical bugs are gone, open it up with an invite system (for example).

If, however, your application is 'trivial' from a technical standpoint (i.e. it's something like Twitter, or Facebook, or Flickr - nothing that is inherently geared towards technical usage), then you're going to have to be more careful in how you plan your testing.  Closed testing is most definitely your first port of call, and this should last for longer than a closed beta on a more 'technical' product.  The reason?  Your 'average Joe' doesn't necessarily know what the word ""beta"" means, and others may well be scared by it, or judge your service prematurely (not understanding the concept of this 'public testing' phase).  Many won't want to be used as guinea pigs.

The weaknesses here are that it gets pretty wordy in the body and you're unlikely to be able to get it down to listing a color only once.  But you might be able to do it only two or three times and you can group those colors together, perhaps in their own sheet.

1320,30818,3271.0,2008-08-27T18:30:47Z,30710,56,"I would suggest mocking out your calls to the database.  Mocks are basically objects that look like the object you are trying to call a method on, in the sense that they have the same properties, methods, etc. available to caller.  But instead of performing whatever action they are programmed to do when a particular method is called, it skips that altogether, and just returns a result. That result is typically defined by you ahead of time.  

In order to set up your objects for mocking, you probably need to use some sort of inversion of control/ dependency injection pattern, as in the following pseudo-code:

class Bar
{
    private FooDataProvider _dataProvider;

    public instantiate(FooDataProvider dataProvider) {
        _dataProvider = dataProvider;
    }

    public getAllFoos() {
        // instead of calling Foo.GetAll() here, we are introducing an extra layer of abstraction
        return _dataProvider.GetAllFoos();
    }
}

class FooDataProvider
{
    public Foo[] GetAllFoos() {
        return Foo.GetAll();
    }
}


Now in your unit test, you create a mock of FooDataProvider, which allows you to call the method GetAllFoos without having to actually hit the database.

class BarTests
{
    public TestGetAllFoos() {
        // here we set up our mock FooDataProvider
        mockRepository = MockingFramework.new()
        mockFooDataProvider = mockRepository.CreateMockOfType(FooDataProvider);

        // create a new array of Foo objects
        testFooArray = new Foo[] {Foo.new(), Foo.new(), Foo.new()}

        // the next statement will cause testFooArray to be returned every time we call FooDAtaProvider.GetAllFoos,
        // instead of calling to the database and returning whatever is in there
        // ExpectCallTo and Returns are methods provided by our imaginary mocking framework
        ExpectCallTo(mockFooDataProvider.GetAllFoos).Returns(testFooArray)

        // now begins our actual unit test
        testBar = new Bar(mockFooDataProvider)
        baz = testBar.GetAllFoos()

        // baz should now equal the testFooArray object we created earlier
        Assert.AreEqual(3, baz.length)
    }
}


A common mocking scenario, in a nutshell.  Of course you will still probably want to unit test your actual database calls too, for which you will need to hit the database.

So we added a custom behavior to the client that adds the username and (encrypted) password to the message headers, and another custom behavior on the server that verifies them.

All very simple, required no changes to the client side service access layer or the service contract implementation. And as it's all done by configuration, if and when we need to move to something a little stronger it'll be easy to migrate.

When it's in place, you can add ?profile=true to any URL that hits a controller. Your action will run as usual, but instead of delivering the rendered page to the browser, it'll send a detailed, nicely formatted ruby-prof page that shows where your action spent its time.

First, add ruby-prof to your Gemfile, probably in the development group:

group :development do
    gem ""ruby-prof""
end


Then add an around filter to your ApplicationController:

around_filter :profile if Rails.env == 'development'

def profile
  if params[:profile] && result = RubyProf.profile { yield }

    out = StringIO.new
    RubyProf::GraphHtmlPrinter.new(result).print out, :min_percent => 0

  else
    yield
  end

Reading the ruby-prof output is a bit of an art, but I'll leave that as an exercise.

If you want to change the measurement type place this:

RubyProf.measure_mode = RubyProf::GC_TIME #example

Before the if in the profile method of the application controller. You can find a list of the available measurements at the ruby-prof page. As of this writing the memory and allocations data streams seem to be corrupted (see defect).

From the last link an interesting quote:


  Let me explain what all that means. 
  Threads run inside the same virtual
  machine, and hence run on the same
  physical machine.  Processes can run
  on the same physical machine or in
  another physical machine.  If you
  architect your application around
  threads, youâve done nothing to access
  multiple machines.  So, you can scale
  to as many cores are on the single
  machine (which will be quite a few
  over time), but to really reach web
  scales, youâll need to solve the
  multiple machine problem anyway.


If you want to use multi core, pyprocessing defines an process based API to do real parallelization. The PEP also includes some interesting benchmarks.

There are exceptions, though. One place you see buffers (output this time) is in the servlet API. Data isn't written to the underlying stream until flush() is called, allowing you to buffer output but then dump the buffer if an error occurs and write an error page instead. You might buffer input if you needed to reset the stream for rereading using mark(int) and reset(). For example, maybe you'd inspect the file header before deciding on which content handler to pass the stream to.

Unrelated, but I think you should rewrite your stream handling. This pattern works best to avoid resource leaks:

    InputStream stream = new FileInputStream(""in"");
    try { //no operations between open stream and try block
        //work
    } finally { //do nothing but close this one stream in the finally
        stream.close();
    }


If you are opening multiple streams, nest try/finally blocks.

Another thing your code is doing is making the assumption that the returned content is encoded in your VM's default character set (though that might be adequate, depending on the use case).

If your employee table has 10,000 records, and only 5 records have employeetypeID in (1,2,3), then it will most likely use the index to fetch the records.  However, if it finds that 9,000 records have the employeeIDType in (1,2,3), then it would most likely just do a table scan to get the corresponding EmployeeIDs, as it's faster just to run through the whole table than to go to each branch of the index tree and look at the records individually.  

SQL Server does a lot of stuff to try and optimize how the queries run.  However, sometimes it doesn't get the right answer.  If you know that SQL Server isn't using the index, by looking at the execution plan in query analyzer, you can tell the query engine to use a specific index with the following change to your query.

But it's also much more limiting -- [A-Za-z] does not match accented international characters, it's literally the A-Za-z ASCII set and nothing more.

I don't know if you saw Tim Bray's answer to my message, but it's a good one:


  One of the trickiest issues in internationalized search is upper and lower case. This notion of case is limited to languages written in the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic character sets. English-speakers naturally expect search to be case-insensitive if only because theyâre lazy: if Nadia Jones wants to look herself up on Google sheâll probably just type in nadia jones and expect the system to take care of it.
  
  So itâs fairly common for search systems to ânormalizeâ words by converting them all to lower- or upper-case, both for indexing and queries.
  
  The trouble is that the mapping between cases is not always as straightforward as it is in English. For example, the German lower-case character âÃâ becomes âSSâ when upper-cased, and good old capital âIâ when down-cased in Turkish becomes the dotless âÄ±â (yes, they have âiâ, its upper-case version is âÄ°â). I have read (but not verified first-hand) that the rules for upcasing accented characters such âÃ©â are different in France and QuÃ©bec. One of the results of all this is that software such as java.String.toLowerCase() tends to run astonishingly slow as it tries to work around all these corner-cases.

The NOLOCK hint has nothing to do with the index options. The hint tells SQL
Server not to request locks when doing SELECT operations, so there will be
no conflict with data that is already locked. The index options just tell
SQL Server that this level of locking is allowed, when locking is going to
occur. For example, if ALLOW_ROW_LOCKS was off, the only possible locks
would be page or table locks. The index options don't force locks to be
held, they just control the possible size of the locks.

In answer to the question in your subject, the NOLOCK hint and the

Note the data context is disconnected. The connection is only made when the query data is enumerated (not when you first run the query, it's a 'lazy' data type so only provides data when it's needed), and then closed immediately afterwards. On .SubmitChanges() the connection is opened to submit the changes then closed immediately afterwards. So don't think keeping the datacontext around keeps a connection open, it doesn't (you can hook the StateChange event of the connection to confirm this for yourself, that's how I'm sure).

However, Python threads are serialized by the GIL when they enter interpreter core. This means that if two threads are crunching numbers, only one can run at any given moment. It also means that you can't take advantage of multi-core or multi-processor architectures.

There are solutions like running multiple Python interpreters concurrently, using a C based threading library. This is not for the faint of heart and the benefits might not be worth the trouble. Let's hope for an all Python solution in a future release.

Because the thread scheduling algorithm can swap between threads at any time, you don't know the order in which the threads will attempt to access the shared data. Therefore, the result of the change in data is dependent on the thread scheduling algorithm, i.e. both threads are ""racing"" to access/change the data. 

Problems often occur when one thread does a ""check-then-act"" (e.g. ""check"" if the value is X, then ""act"" to do something that depends on the value being X) and another thread does something to the value in between the ""check"" and the ""act"". E.g:

if (x == 5) // The ""Check""
{
   y = x * 2; // The ""Act""

   // If another thread changed x in between ""if (x == 5)"" and ""y = x * 2"" above,
   // y will not be equal to 10.
}


The point being, y could be 10, or it could be anything, depending on whether another thread changed x in between the check and act. You have no real way of knowing.

In order to prevent race conditions from occurring, you would typically put a lock around the shared data to ensure only one thread can access the data at a time. This would mean something like this:

// Obtain lock for x
if (x == 5)
{
   y = x * 2; // Now, nothing can change x until the lock is released. 
              // Therefore y = 10
}
// release lock for x

The reason you may not have heard of this keyword in C is that it is the default storage class for all types :-)  The alternatives are ""static"", which means ""allocate this variable statically (to a single global location in memory), and refer to this same memory location throughout the execution of the program, regardless of how many times the function is invoked"", and ""volatile"", which means ""this is a register elsewhere on my SoC or something on another device which I have no control over; compiler, please don't optimize reads to me away, even when you think you know my value from previous reads with no intermediate writes in the code"".

""automatic"" is intended for recursive functions, but also for running the same function in different threads of execution concurrently.  For instance, if you ""fork"" off N different blocks (using Verilog's fork->join statement), and have them all call the same function at the same time, the same problems arise as a function calling itself recursively.

In many cases, your code will be just fine without declaring the task or function as ""automatic"", but it's good practice to put it in there unless you specifically need it to be otherwise.

we removed all unique indexes

If you're designing a parallel scientific application, go with MPI, but if you are designing a persistent distributed system that needs to be resilient to faults and network instability, use one of the others.

MPI has very limited facilities for fault tolerance; the default error handling behavior in most implementations is a system-wide fail.  Also, the semantics of MPI require that all messages sent eventually be consumed.  This makes a lot of sense for simulations on a  cluster, but not for a distributed application.

double[] signal = (some 1d signal);

double[] result = new double[signal.Length + filter.Length + 1];

    result[i+j] = result[i+j] + signal[i] * filter[j];


Note that the example is extremely simplified. It does not do range checks and does not handle the edges properly. The filter used (box-car) is a particularly bad lowpass filter, because it will cause a lot of artifacts (ringing). Read up on filter design.

You can also implement the filters in the frequency domain. Here is how you implement a high-pass filter using FFT:

double[] signal = (some 1d signal);
// Do FFT:
double[] real;
double[] imag;
[real, imag] = fft(signal)

// Set the first quarter of the real part to zero to attenuate the low frequencies
for (int i=0; i < real.Length / 4; i++) 
  real[i] = 0;

// Do inverse FFT:
double[] highfrequencysignal = inversefft(real, imag);


Again, this is simplified, but you get the idea. The code does not look as complicated as the math.

Update: I forgot to mention that for beginners, I'd also recommend messing around in a graphical client, which removes the command-line hassle from the learning experience. RapidSVN is a reasonable cross-platform client. You'll also find that common IDEs either come with Subversion support, or have plugins which can be installed, which allow most version control operations to be performed within that environment.

@John Millikin: While setting up a Subversion server can be complicated, depending on one's general admin experience, don't forget that you don't need to do that just to mess about with a repository and get to grips with the basics - the client can interact with a repository in the local filesystem.

1608,35715,3429.0,2008-08-30T05:48:56Z,35700,9,"I maintained for a number of years an ANSI C networking library that was ported to close to 30 different OS's and compilers.  The library didn't have any GUI components, which made it easier.  We ended up abstracting out into dedicated source files any routine that was not consistent across platforms, and used #defines where appropriate in those source files.  This kept the code that was adjusted per platform isolated away from the main business logic of the library.  We also made extensive use of typedefs and our own dedicated types so that we could easily change them per platform if needed.  This made the port to 64-bit platforms fairly easy.

If you are looking to have GUI components, I would suggest looking at GUI toolkits such as WxWindows or Qt (which are both C++ libraries).

For just getting started the emulator is very good. You're going to use the emulator during development most of the time anyway so if you're just figuring things out it is fine to use just that. You can also tweak the emulator to emulate the specific hardware you want to use (add io ports etc.) so if you're not clear on what you want to do or what you need this is a good way to try stuff out.

If you know exactly what you want to build it might be a good idea to think about what hardware you're going to need as soon as possible. There are some developer boards out there for the microframework that you might use for sideshow. Or if you've got specific needs you might end up developing your own hardware and porting the microframework to it. I don't really know what you need so I can't recommend a specific hardware platform. There are some examples on the microsoft microframework site that you might want to look at. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/embedded/bb267253.aspx look under the heading developer kits.

Since some of those results will still be more than 50 miles away, then I used the great circle formula once more on that small list of coordinates.  Then I printed out the list along with the distance from the target.

Therefore non-temporal stores must be followed by an SFENCE instruction in order for their results to be seen by other processors in a timely fashion.

When data is produced and not (immediately) consumed again, the fact that memory store operations read a full cache line first and then modify the cached data is detrimental to performance. This operation pushes data out of the caches which might be needed again in favor of data which will not be used soon. This is especially true for large data structures, like matrices, which are filled and then used later. Before the last element of the matrix is filled the sheer size evicts the first elements, making caching of the writes ineffective.

For this and similar situations, processors provide support for non-temporal write operations. Non-temporal in this context means the data will not be reused soon, so there is no reason to cache it. These non-temporal write operations do not read a cache line and then modify it; instead, the new content is directly written to memory.

From the docs:

Anyway here's a quick demo walkthrough of using the MultipleLookupField in a web part.

Create a team site. Add a few tasks to the task list. Also put a document in the Shared Documents library. Create a new column in the Shared Documents library; call it ""Related"", have it be a Lookup into the Title field of the Tasks list, and allow multiple values.

Now create a web part, do all the usual boilerplate and then add this:

Label l;
MultipleLookupField mlf;

protected override void CreateChildControls()
{
    base.CreateChildControls();
    SPList list = SPContext.Current.Web.Lists[""Shared Documents""];
    if (list != null && list.Items.Count > 0)
    {
        LiteralControl lit = new LiteralControl(""Associate tasks to "" + 
                             list.Items[0].Name);
        this.Controls.Add(lit);

        mlf = new MultipleLookupField();
        mlf.ControlMode = SPControlMode.Edit;
        mlf.FieldName = ""Related"";
        mlf.ItemId = list.Items[0].ID;
        mlf.ListId = list.ID;
        mlf.ID = ""Related"";
        this.Controls.Add(mlf);

        Button b = new Button();
        b.Text = ""Change"";
        b.Click += new EventHandler(bClick);
        this.Controls.Add(b);

        l = new Label();
        this.Controls.Add(l);
    }

}

void bClick(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    l.Text = """";
    foreach (SPFieldLookupValue val in (SPFieldLookupValueCollection)mlf.Value)
    {
        l.Text += val.LookupValue.ToString() + "" "";
    }
    SPListItem listitem = mlf.List.Items[0];
    listitem[""Related""] = mlf.Value;
    listitem.Update();
    mlf.Value = listitem[""Related""];
}

protected override void OnInit(EventArgs e)
{
    base.OnInit(e);
    EnsureChildControls();
}


Granted, this is borderline ridiculous -- everything is hard-coded, there is no error-handling at all, and it serves no useful purpose -- but it's only meant as a quick demo. Now build and deploy this web part and add an instance of it to your team site's homepage; it should allow you to get and set the tasks which are associated with the first document in the library.

The strange bit towards the end of the button Click handler, where we read a value from mlf.Value and then write it back again, appears to be required if you want the UI to stay in sync with the actual list values. Try omitting the last line of bClick to see what I mean. This has been driving me nuts for the last hour or so, and I'm hoping another commenter can come up with a better approach...

1847,40121,4050.0,2008-09-02T17:38:58Z,40090,20,"Just to satisfy some curiosity:

From Why doesn't C# support default parameters?:


  In languages such as C++, a default value can be included as part of the method declaration:
  
  void Process(Employee employee, bool bonus = false)
  
  This method can be called either with:
  
  a.Process(employee, true);
  
  or
  
  a.Process(employee);
  
  in the second case, the parameter bonus is set to false.
  
  C# doesn't have this feature.
  
  One reason we don't have this feature is related to a specific implementation of the feature. In the C++ world, when the user writes:
  
  a.Process(employee);
  
  the compiler generates
  
  a.process(employee, false);
  
  In other words, the compiler takes the default value that is specified in the method prototype and puts it into the method call - it's just as if the user wrote 'false' as the second parameter. There's no way to change that default value without forcing the user of the class to recompile, which is unfortunate.
  
  The overloading model works better in this respect. The framework author just defines two separate methods, and the single-parameter one calls the two-parameter method. This keeps the default value in the framework, where it can be modified if necessary.
  
  It would be possible for a compiler to take something like the C++ definition and produce the overloads, but there are a few issues with that approach.
  
  The first one is that the correlation between the code that the user writes and the code the compiler generates is less obvious. We generally try to limit magic when possible, as it makes it harder for programmers. The second issue has to do with things like XML doc comments and intellisense. The compiler would have to have special rules for how it generates doc comments for the overloaded methods, and intellisense would need to have smarts to collapse the overloaded methods into a single method.
  
  Writing overloads yourself is a bit less convenient, but we think it's an acceptable solution.

1860,40303,3893.0,2008-09-02T18:56:50Z,40230,8,"Using Guids as primary keys is acceptable and is considered a fairly standard practice for the same reasons that you are considering them.  They can be overused which can make things a bit tedious to debug and manage, so try to keep them out of code tables and other reference data if at all possible.

The thing that you have to concern yourself with is the human readable identifier.  Guids cannot be exchanged by people - can you imagine trying to confirm your order number over the phone if it is a guid?  So in an offline scenario you may still have to generate something - like a publisher (workstation/user) id and some sequence number, so the order number may be 123-5678 -.  

However this may not satisfy business requirements of having a sequential number.  In fact regulatory requirements can be and influence - some regulations (SOX maybe) require that invoice numbers are sequential.  In such cases it may be neccessary to generate a sort of proforma number which is fixed up later when the systems synchronise.  You may land up with tables having OrderId (Guid), OrderNo (int), ProformaOrderNo (varchar) - some complexity may creep in.

At least having guids as primary keys means that you don't have to do a whole lot of cascading updates when the sync does eventually happen - you simply update the human readable number.

1870,40523,4192.0,2008-09-02T20:25:37Z,40480,3038,"Java is always pass-by-value. Unfortunately, they decided to call pointers references, thus confusing newbies. Because those references are passed by value.

It goes like this:

public static void main( String[] args ){
    Dog aDog = new Dog(""Max"");
    foo(aDog);

    if (aDog.getName().equals(""Max"")) { //true
        System.out.println( ""Java passes by value."" );

    } else if (aDog.getName().equals(""Fifi"")) {
        System.out.println( ""Java passes by reference."" );

public static void foo(Dog d) {
    d.getName().equals(""Max""); // true

    d = new Dog(""Fifi"");
    d.getName().equals(""Fifi""); // true
}


In this example aDog.getName() will still return ""Max"". The value aDog within main is not overwritten in the function foo with the Dog ""Fifi"" as the object reference is passed by value. If it were passed by reference, then the aDog.getName() in main would return ""Fifi"" after the call to foo.

Likewise:

Dog aDog = new Dog(""Max"");
foo(aDog);
aDog.getName().equals(""Fifi""); // true
public void foo(Dog d) {
    d.getName().equals(""Max""); // true
    d.setName(""Fifi"");

In the above example, FiFi is the dog's name after call to foo(aDog). Any operations that foo performs on d are such that, for all practical purposes, they are performed on aDog itself (except d=new Dog(""Boxer"")).

I would recommend to read up on cryptography in general and then do some threat modeling. Some questions (by no means a comprehensive list) you should ask yourself:


Is the module doing the encryption the one which needs to decrypt it (in this case use symmetric crypto) or will it send data to an other module (on an other machine) which will use it (in which case you should consider public-key crypto)
What do you want to protect against? Someone accessing the database but not having the sourcecode (in which case you can hardcode the encryption key directly into the source)? Someone sniffing your local network (you should consider transparent solutions like IPSec)? Someone stealing your server (it can happen even in data centers - in which case full disk encryption should be considered)?
Do you really need to keep the data? Can't you directly pass it to the credit card processor and erase it after you get the confirmation? Can't you store it locally at the client in a cookie or Flash LSO? If you store it at the client, make sure that you encrypt it at the server side before putting it in a cookie. Also, if you are using cookies, make sure that you make them http only.
Is it enough to compare the equality of the data (ie the data that the client has given me is the same data that I have)? If so, consider storing a hash of it. Because credit card numbers are relatively short and use a reduced set of symbols, a unique salt should be generated for each before hashing.


Later edit: note that standard encryption algorithms from the same category (for example 3DES and AES - both being symmetric block cyphers) are of comparable strength. Most (commercial) systems are not broken because somebody bruteforced their encryption, but because their threat modelling was not detailed enough (or flat out they didn't have any). For example you can encrypt all the data, but if you happen to have a public facing web interface which is vulnerable to SQL injection, it won't help you much.

it has a Windows installer or you can build it from sources

  To summarize, I've argued that XEmacs has a much lower market share, poorer performance, more bugs, much lower stability, and at this point probably fewer features than GNU Emacs. When you add it all up, it's the weaker candidate by a large margin.

The link that appears to be most promising (www.nondot.org/sabre/os/articles) is no longer available, so you'll need to poke through the Archive.org version to read it.

At the end of the day the bootloader takes the machine code of the kernel, puts it in memory, and jumps to it.  You can put any machine code in the kernel that you want, but most C programs expect an OS so you'll need to tell your compiler that it won't have all that, or the bootloader has to create some of it.

The kernel then does all the heavy lifting, and I suspect it's the example kernel you want.  But there's a long way to go between having a kernel that says, ""Hello world"" to having a kernel that loads a command interpretor, provides disk services, and loads and manages programs.

You might want to consider subscribing to ACM to get access to their older literature - there are lots of articles in the late 80's and early 90's in early computing magazines about how to create alternative OSs.  There are likely books that are out of print from this era as well.

Always use transactions
Don't use Close(), instead wrap your calls on an ISession inside a using statement or manage the lifecycle of your ISession somewhere else.


From the documentation:


  From time to time the ISession will execute the SQL statements needed to synchronize the ADO.NET connection's state with the state of objects held in memory. This process, flush, occurs by default at the following points
  
  
  from some invocations of Find() or Enumerable()
  from NHibernate.ITransaction.Commit()
  from ISession.Flush() 
  
  
  The SQL statements are issued in the following order
  
  
  all entity insertions, in the same order the corresponding objects were saved using ISession.Save()
  all entity updates
  all collection deletions
  all collection element deletions, updates and insertions
  all collection insertions
  all entity deletions, in the same order the corresponding objects were deleted using ISession.Delete()
  
  
  (An exception is that objects using native ID generation are inserted when they are saved.)
  
  Except when you explicity Flush(), there are absolutely no guarantees about when the Session executes the ADO.NET calls, only the order in which they are executed. However, NHibernate does guarantee that the ISession.Find(..) methods will never return stale data; nor will they return the wrong data.
  
  It is possible to change the default behavior so that flush occurs less frequently. The FlushMode class defines three different modes: only flush at commit time (and only when the NHibernate ITransaction API is used), flush automatically using the explained routine, or never flush unless Flush() is called explicitly. The last mode is useful for long running units of work, where an ISession is kept open and disconnected for a long time.


...

Also refer to this section:


  Ending a session involves four distinct phases:
  
  
  flush the session
  commit the transaction
  close the session
  handle exceptions 
  
  
  Flushing the Session
  
  If you happen to be using the ITransaction API, you don't need to worry about this step. It will be performed implicitly when the transaction is committed. Otherwise you should call ISession.Flush() to ensure that all changes are synchronized with the database.
  
  Committing the database transaction
  
  If you are using the NHibernate ITransaction API, this looks like:

tx.Commit(); // flush the session and commit the transaction

  
  If you are managing ADO.NET transactions yourself you should manually Commit() the ADO.NET transaction.

sess.Flush();
currentTransaction.Commit();

  
  If you decide not to commit your changes:

tx.Rollback();  // rollback the transaction

  
  or:

currentTransaction.Rollback();

  
  If you rollback the transaction you should immediately close and discard the current session to ensure that NHibernate's internal state is consistent.
  
  Closing the ISession
  
  A call to ISession.Close() marks the end of a session. The main implication of Close() is that the ADO.NET connection will be relinquished by the session.

tx.Commit();
sess.Close();

sess.Flush();
currentTransaction.Commit();
sess.Close();

  
  If you provided your own connection, Close() returns a reference to it, so you can manually close it or return it to the pool. Otherwise Close() returns it to the pool.

2052,43944,619.0,2008-09-04T15:03:25Z,43870,272,"Update as of PostgreSQL 9.0:

Recent versions of Postgres (since late 2010) have the string_agg(expression, delimiter) function that will do exactly what the question asked for, even letting you specify the delimiter string:

SELECT company_id, string_agg(employee, ', ')
FROM mytable
GROUP BY company_id;


Update as of PostgreSQL 8.4:

PostgreSQL 8.4 (in 2009) introduced the aggregate function array_agg(expression) which concatenates the values into an array. Then array_to_string() can be used to give the desired result:

SELECT company_id, array_to_string(array_agg(employee), ', ')
FROM mytable
GROUP BY company_id;


Original Answer (for pre-8.4 PostgreSQL):

There is no built-in aggregate function to concatenate strings. It seems like this would be needed, but it's not part of the default set. A web search however reveals some manual implementations the same example:

CREATE AGGREGATE textcat_all(
  basetype    = text,
  sfunc       = textcat,
  stype       = text,
  initcond    = ''
);


Here is the CREATE AGGREGATE documentation.

In order to get the "", "" inserted in between them without having it at the end, you might want to make your own concatenation function and substitute it for the ""textcat"" above. Here is one I put together but haven't tested (update: tested on 8.3.12 and working fine):

CREATE FUNCTION commacat(acc text, instr text) RETURNS text AS $$
  BEGIN
    IF acc IS NULL OR acc = '' THEN
      RETURN instr;
    ELSE
      RETURN acc || ', ' || instr;
    END IF;
  END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;


Note: The function above will output a comma even if the value in the row is null/empty, which outputs:

a, b, c, , e, , g


If you would prefer to remove extra commas to output:

a, b, c, e, g


just add an ELSIF check to the function:

CREATE FUNCTION commacat_ignore_nulls(acc text, instr text) RETURNS text AS $$
  BEGIN
    IF acc IS NULL OR acc = '' THEN
      RETURN instr;
    ELSIF instr IS NULL OR instr = '' THEN
      RETURN acc;
    ELSE
      RETURN acc || ', ' || instr;

A script is ran that copies Dev to Test.
Dev is now frozen while business owners UAT on the Test enviroment. If a defect is found, it is fixed in dev and then promoted back to Test.

http://weblogs.sqlteam.com/jeffs/articles/1490.aspx

It's a bit hack-ish, though: it requires access to the sp_OA___ extended procedures.

The summary is that you can simulate an aggregate function with a series of four wrapper functions, each of which performs one of the following tasks:


Create an ActiveX object that can hold state within the query. Call this before running the query.
Do the actual aggregation using the ActiveX object.
Clear the ActiveX object state on GROUP BY boundries
Destroy the object.  Call this after running the query and during error handling.


You then include items 2 and 3 in the select list for your query, and item 2 must also be wrapped in an existing no-effect aggregate function like MAX() or MIN().  You can also use this technique for cumulative functions to do things like row numbers.

Some of the comments suggest that the optimizer may try to negate the aggregation effects by optimizing away the calls in some circumstances, though I expect that would be a very rare case indeed.  However, I found this question because I took those warnings seriously enough to continue searching for something better.

Edit /etc/mail/sendmail.mc to include the line:

  define(`SMART_HOST',`mailrelay.example.com')dnl


After changing the sendmail.mc macro configuration file, it must be recompiled
to produce the sendmail configuration file.

  # m4 /etc/mail/sendmail.mc > /etc/sendmail.cf


And restart the sendmail service (Linux):

  # /etc/init.d/sendmail restart


As well as setting the smarthost, you might want to also disable name resolution configuration and possibly shift your sendmail to non-standard port, or disable daemon mode.

Disable Name Resolution

Servers that are within fire-walled networks or using Network Address
Translation (NAT) may not have DNS or NIS services available. This creates
a problem for sendmail, since it will use DNS by default, and if it is not
available you will see messages like this in mailq:

  host map: lookup (mydomain.com): deferred)


Unless you are prepared to setup an appropriate DNS or NIS service that
sendmail can use, in this situation you will typically configure name
resolution to be done using the /etc/hosts file. This is done by enabling
a 'service.switch' file and specifying resolution by file, as follows:

1: Enable service.switch for sendmail
Edit /etc/mail/sendmail.mc to include the lines:

  define(`confSERVICE_SWITCH_FILE',`/etc/mail/service.switch')dnl


2: Configure service.switch for files
Create or modify /etc/mail/service.switch to refer only to /etc/hosts for name
resolution:

  # cat /etc/mail/service.switch
  hosts files


3: Recompile sendmail.mc and restart sendmail for this setting to take effect.

Shift sendmail to non-standard port, or disable daemon mode

By default, sendmail will listen on port 25. You may want to change this port
or disable the sendmail daemon mode altogether for various reasons:
- if there is a security policy prohibiting the use of well-known ports
- if another SMTP product/process is to be running on the same host on the standard port
- if you don't want to accept mail via smtp at all, just send it using sendmail

1: To shift sendmail to use non-standard port.
Edit /etc/mail/sendmail.mc and modify the ""Port"" setting in the line:

  DAEMON_OPTIONS(`Port=smtp,Addr=127.0.0.1, Name=MTA')


For example, to get sendmail to use port 125:

  DAEMON_OPTIONS(`Port=125,Addr=127.0.0.1, Name=MTA')


This will require sendmail.mc to be recompiled and sendmail to be restarted.

2: Alternatively, to disable sendmail daemon mode altogether (Linux)
Edit /etc/sysconfig/sendmail and modify the ""DAEMON"" setting to:

  DAEMON=no


This change will require sendmail to be restarted.

  Just before the old markup is replaced with the updated HTML, all the DOM elements in the panel are examined for Microsoft Ajax behaviours or controls attached to them. To avoid memory leaks, the components associated with DOM elements are disposed, and then destroyed when the HTMl is replaced.


So as far as I know, any asp.net ajax components within the update panel are disposed to prevent memory leaks, but anything else in there will just be replaced with the html received.

So if you don't have any asp.net ajax components in the target container for the response, it would be basically the same as an inner html replacement with any other js framework / ajax request, so i would say that it's just the how the browser handles this, rather than asp.net ajax causing this.

Also, while it may be ""leaking"", it may be by design, meaning that the browser might not have reclaimed the dom elements yet and released them. Also, drip might be causing those to leak, as it is attaching to those dom elements.

Instead of disabling shutdown altogether, maybe you can just increase the amount of time it waits before killing the process.  The server is essentially conserving resources - if your server can stand the resource allocation for a process that mostly sits around doing nothing, then there isn't any harm in letting it be.

As you mentioned, setting the auto-recycling of the process on a memory limit would be a good idea, if the possibility of a memory leak is there.

2128,45237,305.0,2008-09-05T04:40:18Z,45230,10,"Another way to go would be to use ssh tunneling (which happens on the client side).

You'd do an ssh command like this:

ssh -L 8022:myinsideserver:22 paul@myoutsideserver


That connects you to the machine that's accessible from the outside (myoutsideserver) and creates a tunnel through that ssh connection to port 22 (the standard ssh port) on the server that's only accessible from the inside.

Then you'd do another ssh command like this (leaving the first one still connected):

ssh -p 8022 paul@localhost


That connection to port 8022 on your localhost will then get tunneled through the first ssh connection taking you over myinsideserver.


There may be something you have to do on myoutsideserver to allow forwarding of the ssh port.  I'm double-checking that now.

Edit

Hmmm.  The ssh manpage says this:  **Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.  **

That sort of implies to me that the first ssh connection has to be as root.  Maybe somebody else can clarify that.

It looks like superuser privileges aren't required as long as the forwarded port (in this case, 8022) isn't a privileged port (like 22).  Thanks for the clarification Mike Stone.

21851,406947,50911.0,2009-01-02T14:42:29Z,45340,28,"This example uses ASP.NET Routing to implement friendly URLs.  

Examples of the mappings that the application handles are:  

http://samplesite/userid/1234 - http://samplesite/users.aspx?userid=1234
http://samplesite/userid/1235 - http://samplesite/users.aspx?userid=1235  

This example uses querystrings and avoids any requirement to modify the code on the aspx page.  

Step 1 - add the necessary entries to web.config

<system.web>
<compilation debug=""true"">
    	<assemblies>
    		â¦
    		<add assembly=""System.Web.Routing, Version=3.5.0.0,    Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31BF3856AD364E35""/>

    </handlers>
</system.webServer>


Step 2 - add a routing table in global.asax

Define the mapping from the friendly URL to the aspx page, saving the requested userid for later use.  

void Application_Start(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    RegisterRoutes(RouteTable.Routes);
}

public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)
{
    routes.Add(""UseridRoute"", new Route
    (
       ""userid/{userid}"",
       new CustomRouteHandler(""~/users.aspx"")
    ));
}


Step 3 - implement the route handler

Add the querystring to the current context before the routing takes place.  

using System.Web.Compilation;
using System.Web.UI;
using System.Web;
using System.Web.Routing;

public class CustomRouteHandler : IRouteHandler
{
    public CustomRouteHandler(string virtualPath)
    {
        this.VirtualPath = virtualPath;
    }

    public string VirtualPath { get; private set; }

    public IHttpHandler GetHttpHandler(RequestContext
          requestContext)
    {
        // Add the querystring to the URL in the current context
        string queryString = ""?userid="" + requestContext.RouteData.Values[""userid""];
        HttpContext.Current.RewritePath(
          string.Concat(
          VirtualPath,
          queryString)); 

        var page = BuildManager.CreateInstanceFromVirtualPath
             (VirtualPath, typeof(Page)) as IHttpHandler;
        return page;
    }
}


Code from users.aspx

The code on the aspx page for reference.  

protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    string id = Page.Request.QueryString[""userid""];
    switch (id)
    {
        case ""1234"":
            lblUserId.Text = id;

SVN is:


free,  
good enough (see disadvantages below),  
simple,  
works fine on Windows (and Linux too), 
a lot of people use it so it's easy to get help, 
can integrate with most of IDEs i.e. Visual Studio (i.e. ankhsvn or VisualSVN -- more info) or Eclipse (i.e. Subclipse -- here someone asked about that).


I would strongly recommended separate machine to source control server. At best somewhere on the cloud. Advantages:


You don't lost your source control repositories if your development box dies.
You don't have to worry about maintenance of one more box.


There are companies which host SVN repositories.

Here are links to SVN (client and server) packages for various operating systems.

Disadvantages of SVN

I am using SVN on Windows machine for about 5 years and found that SVN has a few disadvantages :).

It is slow on large repositories

SVN (or its client -- TortoiseSVN) has one big disadvantage -- it terrible slow (while updating or committing) on large (thousands of files) repositories unless you have SSD drive.

Merging can be difficult

Many people complain about how hard merging is with SVN.

I do merging for about 4 years (including about 2 years in CVS -- that was terrible, but doable) and about 2 years with SVN.

And personally I don't find it hard -- on the other hand -- any merge is easy after merging branches in CVS :).

I do merge of large repository (two repositories in fact) once a week and rarely I have conflicts which are hard to solve (most of conflicts are solved automatically with diff software which I use).

However in case of project of a few developers merging should not be problem at all if you keep a few simple rules:


merge changes often,
avoid active development in various branches simultaneously.


Added in July 2011

Many devs recommended Distributed Version Control like Git or Mercurial.

From single developer perspective there are only a few important advantages of DVCS over SVN:


DVCS can be faster.
You can commit to local repository without access to central one.
DVCS is hot thing and fancy to use/learn (if someone pay for your learning).


And I don't think merging is a problem in case of single developer.

Joel Spolsky wrote tutorial about Mercurial which is definitively worth to read.

So, despite of many advantages of DVCS I would stay with SVN if merging or speed is not a problem.

Or try Mercurial, which according to this and this SO questions, is better supported (in July 2011) on Windows.

Added in July 2014

For about a year I use Git (Git Bash mainly) for my pet-projects (i.e. solving Euler problems) and local branches for each Euler problem are really nice feature -- exactly as it is described as advantage of DVCS. 

Today Git tooling on Windows is much, much better then 2 or more years ago.
You can use remote repo (like GitHub or ProjectLocker and many others) to keep 
copy of your project away from your workstation with no extra effort/money.

However I use GUI client only to looks at diffs (and sometimes to choose files to commit),
so it's better to not afraid of command line -- it's really nice.

So as of today I would go with Git.

I think that forms should be exclusively used as what they are basically, meaning graphic interface only, meaning here that they do not have to be debugged! The debugging job is then limited to your VBA modules and objects, which is a lot easier to handle. 

There is of course a natural tendency to add VBA code to forms and/or controls, specially when Access offers you these great ""after Update"" and ""on change"" events, but I definitely advise you not to put any form or control specific code in the form's module. This makes further maintenance and upgrade very costy, where your code is split between VBA modules and forms/controls modules.

This does not mean you cannot use anymore this AfterUpdate event! Just put standard code in the event, like this:

Private Sub myControl_AfterUpdate()  
    CTLAfterUpdate myControl
    On Error Resume Next
    Eval (""CTLAfterUpdate_MyForm()"")
    On Error GoTo 0  
End sub


Where:


CTLAfterUpdate is a standard procedure run each time a control is updated in a form
CTLAfterUpdateMyForm is a specific procedure run each time a control is updated on MyForm


I have then 2 modules. The first one is 


utilityFormEvents
 where I will have my CTLAfterUpdate generic event


The second one is 


MyAppFormEvents
 containing the specific code of all specific forms of the MyApp application
 and including the CTLAfterUpdateMyForm procedure. Of course, CTLAfterUpdateMyForm
 might not exist if there are no specific code to run. This is why we turn the 
 ""On error"" to ""resume next"" ...


Choosing such a generic solution means a lot. It means you are reaching a high level of code normalization (meaning painless maintenance of code). And when you say that you do not have any form-specific code,  it also means that form modules are fully standardized, and their production can be automated: just say which events you want to manage at the form/control level, and define your generic/specific procedures terminology.
Write your automation code, once for all.
It takes a few  days of work but it give exciting results. I have been using this solution for the last 2 years and it is clearly the right one: my forms are fully and automatically created from scratch with a ""Forms Table"", linked to a ""Controls Table"".
I can then spend my time working on the specific procedures of the form, if any.

Code normalization, even with MS Access, is a long process. But it is really worth the pain!

Also... this is by no means a perfect (or even good) solution to a large viewstate.  As always, minimize the size of the viewstate as much as possible.

2269,48134,2915.0,2008-09-07T04:15:38Z,48110,1,"You can generally twist a code coverage tool's arm and get a report that shows the paths that have been executed during a given run.  This report should show the code itself, with the first few columns marked up according to the coverage tool's particular notation on whether a given path was executed.

You might be able to use this straight up, or you might have to preprocess it and either remove the code that was not executed, or add a new notation on each line that tells whether it was executed (most tools will only show path information at control points):

So from a coverage tool you might get a report like this:

T- if(sometest)
   {
x     somecode;
   }
   else
   {
-     someother_code;
   }


The notation T- indicates that the if statement only ever evaluated to true, and so only the first part of the code executed.  The later notation 'x' indicates that this line was executed.

You should be able to form a regex that matches only when the first column contains a T, F, or x so you can capture all the control statements executed and lines executed.

Sometimes you'll only get coverage information at each control point, which then requires you to parse the C file and mark the execute lines yourself.  Not as easy, but not impossible either.

Still, this sounds like an interesting question where the solution is probably more work than it's worth...

Click on button
AnimationExtender catches action and call clickOn callback
linkPostback starts asynchronous request for page and then returns flow to AnimationExtender
Animation begins
pageRequest returns and calls playAnimation, which starts the animation again


I think there are at least two ways around this issue.  It seems you have almost all the javascript you need, you just need to work around AnimationExtender starting the animation on a click.

Option 1: Hide the AnimationExtender button and add a new button of your own that plays the animation.  This should be as simple as setting the AE button's style to ""display: none;"" and having your own button call linkPostback().

Option 2: Re-disable the Animation Extender once the animation has finished with.  This should work, as long as the playAnimation call is blocking, which it probably is:

function linkPostback() {

    var prm = Sys.WebForms.PageRequestManager.getInstance();
    prm.add_endRequest(playAnimation)
}

function playAnimation() {

    AnimationExtender.Enabled = true;
    var onclkBehavior = $find(""ctl00_btnOpenList"").get_OnClickBehavior().get_animation();
    onclkBehavior.play();
    AnimationExtender.Enabled = false;
}


As an aside, it seems your general approach may face issues if there is a delay in receiving the pageRequest.  It may be a bit weird to click a button and several seconds later have the animation happen.  It may be better to either pre-load the data, or to pre-fill the div with some ""Loading..."" thing, make it about the right size, and then populate the actual contents when it arrives.

2307,49483,3750.0,2008-09-08T11:11:30Z,49450,58,"If you want to move the repository and keep history, you'll probably need filesystem access on both hosts.  The simplest solution, if your backend is FSFS (the default on recent versions), is to make a filesystem copy of the entire repository folder.

If you have a Berkley DB backend, if you're not sure of what your backend is, or if you're changing SVN version numbers, you're going to want to use svnadmin to dump your old repository and load it into your new repository.  Using svnadmin dump will give you a single file backup that you can copy to the new system.  Then you can create the new (empty) repository and use svnadmin load, which will essentially replay all the commits along with its metadata (author, timestamp, etc).

You can read more about the dump/load process here:

http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.migrate

Also, if you do svnadmin load, make sure you use the --force-uuid option, or otherwise people are going to have problems switching to the new repository.  Subversion uses a UUID to identify the repository internally, and it won't let you switch a working copy to a different repository.

If you don't have filesystem access, there may be other third party options out there (or you can write something) to help you migrate: essentially you'd have to use the svn log to replay each revision on the new repository, and then fix up the metadata afterwards.  You'll need the pre-revprop-change and post-revprop-change hook scripts in place to do this, which sort of assumes filesystem access, so YMMV.  Or, if you don't want to keep the history, you can use your working copy to import into the new repository.  But hopefully this isn't the case.

2312,49512,5168.0,2008-09-08T11:33:41Z,49510,70,"There are four steps to making an app that can act as the default web browser. The first three steps allow your app to act as a role handler for the relevant URL schemes (HTTP and HTTPS) and the final step makes it the default role handler for those schemes.

1) Add the URL schemes your app can handle to your application's info.plist file

To add support for http:// and https:// you'd need to add the following to your application's info.plist file. This tells the OS that your application is capable of handling HTTP and HTTP URLs.

<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
        <string>http URL</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>http</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
        <string>Secure http URL</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>https</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>


2) Write an URL handler method

This method will be called by the OS when it wants to use your application to open a URL. It doesn't matter which object you add this method to, that'll be explicitly passed to the Event Manager in the next step. The URL handler method should look something like this:

- (void)getUrl:(NSAppleEventDescriptor *)event 
    withReplyEvent:(NSAppleEventDescriptor *)replyEvent
{
  // Get the URL
  NSString *urlStr = [[event paramDescriptorForKeyword:keyDirectObject] 
    stringValue];

  //TODO: Your custom URL handling code here
}


3) Register the URL handler method

Next, tell the event manager which object and method to call when it wants to use your app to load an URL. In the code here I'm passed self as the event handler, assuming that we're calling setEventHandler from the same object that defines the getUrl:withReplyEvent: method.

You should add this code somewhere in your application's initialisation code.

NSAppleEventManager *em = [NSAppleEventManager sharedAppleEventManager];
[em 
  setEventHandler:self 
  andSelector:@selector(getUrl:withReplyEvent:) 
  forEventClass:kInternetEventClass 
  andEventID:kAEGetURL];


Some applications, including early versions of Adobe AIR, use the alternative WWW!/OURL AppleEvent to request that an application opens URLs, so to be compatible with those applications you should also add the following:

[em
  setEventHandler:self 
  andSelector:@selector(getUrl:withReplyEvent:) 
  forEventClass:'WWW!' 
  andEventID:'OURL'];


4) Set your app as the default browser

Everything we've done so far as told the OS that your application is a browser, now we need to make it the default browser.

We've got to use the Launch Services API to do this. In this case we're setting our app to be the default role handler for HTTP and HTTPS links:

CFStringRef bundleID = (CFStringRef)[[NSBundle mainBundle] bundleIdentifier];
OSStatus httpResult = LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme(CFSTR(""http""), bundleID);
OSStatus httpsResult = LSSetDefaultHandlerForURLScheme(CFSTR(""https""), bundleID);
//TODO: Check httpResult and httpsResult for errors


(It's probably best to ask the user's permission before changing their default browser.)

Custom URL schemes

It's worth noting that you can also use these same steps to handle your own custom URL schemes. If you're creating a custom URL scheme it's a good idea to base it on your app's bundle identifier to avoid clashes with other apps. So if your bundle ID is com.example.MyApp you should consider using x-com-example-myapp:// URLs.

Because it has no child elements, you shouldn't get spurious mouseover and mouseout events propagating to it.

What I believe happens, is that when the cursor moves from a parent element onto a child element, a mouseout event occurs on the parent element, and a mouseover event occurs on the child element. However, if the mouseover handler on the child element does not catch the event and stop it propagating, the parent element will also receive the mouseover event.

2336,49957,2257.0,2008-09-08T15:37:41Z,49950,5,"If a class has a Dispose method the best practice is to call it. the reason
behind that is that Dispose runs when called, whereas setting the object to
null simply adds a entry to the Finalize queue in GC, and we cannot
determine when GC will run.

There is no performance benefit in implementing the Dispose method on types that use only managed resources (such as arrays) because they are automatically reclaimed by the garbage collector. Use the Dispose method primarily on managed objects that use native resources and on COM objects that are exposed to the .NET Framework. Managed objects that use native resources (such as the FileStream class) implement the IDisposable interface.

An elegant means of inoking Dispose that have adopted is using the ""using"" construct. For those of you who may not be familiar with the construct, it provide a means to implicity invoke Dispose() on an instance that implements IDisposable even if an exception is thrown durring the operation. The following is an example of the using construct: 

using(DisposableClass dc = new DisposableClass()) 
{ 
   dc.PerformActionOnUmanagedResources(); 
   dc.PerformAnotherActionOnUmanagedResources(); 
}


In the previous example, if an exception was thrown in the PerformActionOnUmanagedResources() method, although the PerformAnotherActionOnUmanagedResources() method would not be processed, the using block will still implicity invoke the Dispose method on dc ensuring the realese of any unmanaged resources.

Also:  in VB.Net array declarations work a little differently.  The subscript you specify in the declaration is the last index, not the number of items created like with C# or C++.   But the array is still 0-indexed like C# or C++, instead of 1-indexed like VB6.  That means that if you move to VB.Net from a different language your array instincts are probably wrong, no matter which language it is.

Firefox has a plug-in called Greasemonkey that allows users to arbitrarily run JavaScript against any page that loads into their browser, and there is nothing you can do about it. Firebug allows you to modify web pages as well as run arbitrary JavaScript.

104677,1777881,36388.0,2009-11-22T05:14:03Z,51150,4,"I know this is very old now, but I just stumbled across it, and I know the answer.

In the applications you've seen (and written) where bringing the dialog box to the foreground did not bring the main window up along with it, the developer has simply neglected to specify the owner of the dialog box.

This applies to both modal windows, like dialog boxes and message boxes, as well as to modeless windows.  Setting the owner of a modeless popup also keeps the popup above its owner at all times.

In the Win32 API, the functions to bring up a dialog box or a message box take the owner window as a parameter:

INT_PTR DialogBox(
    HINSTANCE hInstance,
    LPCTSTR lpTemplate,
    HWND hWndParent,      /* this is the owner */
    DLGPROC lpDialogFunc
);

int MessageBox(
    HWND hWnd,            /* this is the owner */
    LPCTSTR lpText,
    LPCTSTR lpCaption,
    UINT uType
);


Similary, in .NET WinForms, the owner can be specified:

public DialogResult ShowDialog(
    IWin32Window owner
)

public static DialogResult Show(
    IWin32Window owner,
    string text
) /* ...and other overloads that include this first parameter */


Additionally, in WinForms, it's easy to set the owner of a modeless window:

public void Show(
    IWin32Window owner,
)


or, equivalently:

form.Owner = this;
form.Show();


In straight WinAPI code, the owner of a modeless window can be set when the window is created:

HWND CreateWindow(
    LPCTSTR lpClassName,
    LPCTSTR lpWindowName,
    DWORD dwStyle,
    int x,
    int y,
    int nWidth,
    int nHeight,
    HWND hWndParent, /* this is the owner if dwStyle does not contain WS_CHILD */
    HMENU hMenu,
    HINSTANCE hInstance,
    LPVOID lpParam
);


or afterwards:

SetWindowLong(hWndPopup, GWL_HWNDPARENT, (LONG)hWndOwner);


or (64-bit compatible)

SetWindowLongPtr(hWndPopup, GWLP_HWNDPARENT, (LONG_PTR)hWndOwner);


Note that MSDN has the following to say about SetWindowLong[Ptr]:


  Do not call SetWindowLongPtr with the GWLP_HWNDPARENT index to change the parent of a child window. Instead, use the SetParent function. 


This is somewhat misleading, as it seems to imply that the last two snippets above are wrong.  This isn't so.  Calling SetParent will turn the intended popup into a child of the parent window (setting its WS_CHILD bit), rather than making it an owned window.  The code above is the correct way to make an existing popup an owned window.

First, meta-modelling is not a set term, but rather a very fuzzy thing, including modelling models of models and reaching out to terms like MDA.

Second, there are numerous options to developing diagram editors - going the Eclipse way is surely a nice option.

To get you at least started in the Eclipse department:


have a look at MOF, that is architecture for ""meta-modelling"" from the OMG (the guys, that maintain UML)
from there approach EMOF, a sub set which is supported by the Eclipse Modelling Framework in the incarnation of Ecore.
building something on top of GMF might be indeed a good idea, because that's the way existing diagram editors for the Eclipse platform take (e.g. Omondo's EclipseUML)
there are a lot of tools existing in the Eclipse environment, that can utilize Ecore - I simply hope, that GMF builts on top of Ecore itself.

Data is continually added to the series so we just keep the range of y values up to date by inspecting each data point as its added; this is very inexpensive and easy to keep track of. Equal minimum and maximum values are special cased: a spacing of 0 indicates that no markers should be drawn.

We are implementing a process of 

1) Business Requirements Statement (BRS)

2) Functional Specification

3) Technical specification

The BRS covers what the business problems are, and what the requirements are around solutions, testing, security, reliability and delivery. This defines what would make a successful solution.

The functional spec details what is needed, how it should look, how long fields should be, etc.

The technical spec details where the data comes from, any tricky code that may need to be considered.

The customer owns the requirements. The developers own the tech specs, and the functional spec is a middle ground. Testing is done against the tech specs (usually unit testing) then against the functional specs (usually system testing) and then against the requirements (UAT).

The important part of this (and we are struggling with) is that the developers still need to deliver to the functional spec, and the original business requirements. In reality the functional and tech specs are just there for clarity.

In short, my main tip is to first work out the process you wish to implement. Then seek agreement from all parties involved in your proposed process, then work on the templates to fit. The templates themselves are only are a small part of the change you want to make.

Getting the closest string match

The key is that you come up with 3 or 4 (or more) methods of gauging the similarity between your phrases (Levenshtein distance is just one method) - and then using real examples of strings you want to match as similar, you adjust the weightings and combinations of those heuristics until you get something that maximizes the number of positive matches. Then you use that formula for all future matches and you should see great results.

If a user is involved in the process, it's also best if you provide an interface which allows the user to see additional matches that rank highly in similarity in case they disagree with the first choice.

Here's an excerpt from the linked answer. If you end up wanting to use any of this code as is, I apologize in advance for having to convert VBA into C#.



Simple, speedy, and a very useful metric. Using this, I created two separate metrics for evaluating the similarity of two strings. One I call ""valuePhrase"" and one I call ""valueWords"". valuePhrase is just the Levenshtein distance between the two phrases, and valueWords splits the string into individual words, based on delimiters such as spaces, dashes, and anything else you'd like, and compares each word to each other word, summing up the shortest Levenshtein distance connecting any two words. Essentially, it measures whether the information in one 'phrase' is really contained in another, just as a word-wise permutation. I spent a few days as a side project coming up with the most efficient way possible of splitting a string based on delimiters.

valueWords, valuePhrase, and Split function:

Public Function valuePhrase#(ByRef S1$, ByRef S2$)
    valuePhrase = LevenshteinDistance(S1, S2)
End Function

Public Function valueWords#(ByRef S1$, ByRef S2$)
    Dim wordsS1$(), wordsS2$()
    wordsS1 = SplitMultiDelims(S1, "" _-"")
    wordsS2 = SplitMultiDelims(S2, "" _-"")
    Dim word1%, word2%, thisD#, wordbest#
    Dim wordsTotal#
    For word1 = LBound(wordsS1) To UBound(wordsS1)
        wordbest = Len(S2)
        For word2 = LBound(wordsS2) To UBound(wordsS2)
            thisD = LevenshteinDistance(wordsS1(word1), wordsS2(word2))
            If thisD < wordbest Then wordbest = thisD
            If thisD = 0 Then GoTo foundbest
        Next word2
foundbest:
        wordsTotal = wordsTotal + wordbest
    Next word1
    valueWords = wordsTotal

Measures of Similarity

Using these two metrics, and a third which simply computes the distance between two strings, I have a series of variables which I can run an optimization algorithm to achieve the greatest number of matches. Fuzzy string matching is, itself, a fuzzy science, and so by creating linearly independent metrics for measuring string similarity, and having a known set of strings we wish to match to each other, we can find the parameters that, for our specific styles of strings, give the best fuzzy match results.

Initially, the goal of the metric was to have a low search value for for an exact match, and increasing search values for increasingly permuted measures. In an impractical case, this was fairly easy to define using a set of well defined permutations, and engineering the final formula such that they had increasing search values results as desired.



As you can see, the last two metrics, which are fuzzy string matching metrics, already have a natural tendency to give low scores to strings that are meant to match (down the diagonal). This is very good. 

Application
To allow the optimization of fuzzy matching, I weight each metric. As such, every application of fuzzy string match can weight the parameters differently. The formula that defines the final score is a simply combination of the metrics and their weights:

value = Min(phraseWeight*phraseValue, wordsWeight*wordsValue)*minWeight + 
        Max(phraseWeight*phraseValue, wordsWeight*wordsValue)*maxWeight + lengthWeight*lengthValue


Using an optimization algorithm (neural network is best here because it is a discrete, multi-dimentional problem), the goal is now to maximize the number of matches. I created a function that detects the number of correct matches of each set to each other, as can be seen in this final screenshot. A column or row gets a point if the lowest score is assigned the the string that was meant to be matched, and partial points are given if there is a tie for the lowest score, and the correct match is among the tied matched strings. I then optimized it. You can see that a green cell is the column that best matches the current row, and a blue square around the cell is the row that best matches the current column. The score in the bottom corner is roughly the number of successful matches and this is what we tell our optimization problem to maximize.

2682,56537,4309.0,2008-09-11T13:36:18Z,54230,50,"CakePHP's built-in ACL system is really powerful, but poorly documented in terms of actual implementation details. A system that we've used with some success in a number of CakePHP-based projects is as follows.

It's a modification of some group-level access systems that have been documented elsewhere. Our system's aims are to have a simple system where users are authorised on a group-level, but they can have specific additional rights on items that were created by them, or on a per-user basis. We wanted to avoid having to create a specific entry for each user (or, more specifically for each ARO) in the aros_acos table.

We have a Users table, and a Roles table.

Users

user_id, user_name, role_id

Roles

id, role_name

Create the ARO tree for each role (we usually have 4 roles - Unauthorised Guest (id 1), Authorised User (id 2), Site Moderator (id 3) and Administrator (id 4)) :

cake acl create aro / Role.1

cake acl create aro 1 Role.2  ... etc ...

After this, you have to use SQL or phpMyAdmin or similar to add aliases for all of these, as the cake command line tool doesn't do it. We use 'Role-{id}' and 'User-{id}' for all of ours.

We then create a ROOT ACO - 

cake acl create aco / 'ROOT'

and then create ACOs for all the controllers under this ROOT one:

cake acl create aco 'ROOT' 'MyController' ... etc ...

So far so normal. We add an additional field in the aros_acos table called _editown  which we can use as an additional action in the ACL component's actionMap.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `aros_acos` (
`id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
`aro_id` int(11) default NULL,
`aco_id` int(11) default NULL,
`_create` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
`_read` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
`_update` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
`_delete` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
`_editown` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
PRIMARY KEY  (`id`),
KEY `acl` (`aro_id`,`aco_id`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB  DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;


We can then setup the Auth component to use the 'crud' method, which validates the requested controller/action against an AclComponent::check(). In the app_controller we have something along the lines of:

private function setupAuth() {
    if(isset($this->Auth)) {
        ....
        $this->Auth->authorize = 'crud';
        $this->Auth->actionMap = array( 'index'     => 'read',
                        'add'       => 'create',
                        'edit'      => 'update'
                        'editMine'  => 'editown',
                        'view'      => 'read'
                        ... etc ...
                        );
        ... etc ...
    }
}


Again, this is fairly standard CakePHP stuff. We then have a checkAccess method in the AppController that adds in the group-level stuff to check whether to check a group ARO or a user ARO for access:

private function checkAccess() {
    if(!$user = $this->Auth->user()) {
        $role_alias = 'Role-1';
        $user_alias = null;
    } else {
        $role_alias = 'Role-' . $user['User']['role_id'];
        $user_alias = 'User-' . $user['User']['id'];
    }

    // do we have an aro for this user?
    if($user_alias && ($user_aro = $this->User->Aro->findByAlias($user_alias))) {
        $aro_alias = $user_alias;
    } else {
        $aro_alias = $role_alias;
    }

    if ('editown' == $this->Auth->actionMap[$this->action]) {
        if($this->Acl->check($aro_alias, $this->name, 'editown') and $this->isMine()) {
            $this->Auth->allow();
        } else {
            $this->Auth->authorize = 'controller';
            $this->Auth->deny('*');
        }
    } else {
        // check this user-level aro for access
        if($this->Acl->check($aro_alias, $this->name, $this->Auth->actionMap[$this->action])) {
            $this->Auth->allow();
        } else {
            $this->Auth->authorize = 'controller';
            $this->Auth->deny('*');
        }
    }
}


The setupAuth() and checkAccess() methods are called in the AppController's beforeFilter() callback. There's an isMine method in the AppControler too (see below) that just checks that the user_id of the requested item is the same as the currently authenticated user. I've left this out for clarity.

That's really all there is to it. You can then allow / deny particular groups access to specific acos - 

cake acl grant 'Role-2' 'MyController' 'read'

cake acl grant 'Role-2' 'MyController' 'editown'

cake acl deny 'Role-2' 'MyController' 'update'

cake acl deny 'Role-2' 'MyController' 'delete'

I'm sure you get the picture.

Anyway, this answer's way longer than I intended it to be, and it probably makes next to no sense, but I hope it's some help to you ...

-- edit --

As requested, here's an edited (purely for clarity - there's a lot of stuff in our boilerplate code that's meaningless here) isMine() method that we have in our AppController. I've removed a lot of error checking stuff too, but this is the essence of it:

function isMine($model=null, $id=null, $usermodel='User', $foreignkey='user_id') {
    if(empty($model)) {
        // default model is first item in $this->uses array
        $model = $this->uses[0];
    }

    if(empty($id)) {
        if(!empty($this->passedArgs['id'])) {
        $id = $this->passedArgs['id'];
        } elseif(!empty($this->passedArgs[0])) {
            $id = $this->passedArgs[0];
        }
    }

    if(is_array($id)) {
        foreach($id as $i) {
            if(!$this->_isMine($model, $i, $usermodel, $foreignkey)) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }

    return $this->_isMine($model, $id, $usermodel, $foreignkey);
}


function _isMine($model, $id, $usermodel='User', $foreignkey='user_id') {
    $user = Configure::read('curr.loggedinuser'); // this is set in the UsersController on successful login

    if(isset($this->$model)) {
        $model = $this->$model;
    } else {
        $model = ClassRegistry::init($model);
    }

    //read model
    if(!($record = $model->read(null, $id))) {
        return false;
    }

    //get foreign key
    if($usermodel == $model->alias) {

It's such a benefit to be always sure about your data consistency, and to have the data ""in one piece"" (the DB). BTW, PostgreSQL is great in preserving consistency.

However, true, reality is often too performance-demanding ;-), and it pushes you to serve the binary files from the file system. But even then I tend to use the DB as the ""master"" storage for binaries, with all the other relations consistently linked, while providing some file system-based caching mechanism for performance optimization.

Simply run xbuild just as you would execute msbuild on Microsoft .Net Framework. You don't need Monodevelop installed, xbuild comes with the standard Mono installation.

If your build uses custom tasks, they should still work if they don't depend on Windows executables (such as rmdir or xcopy).

When you are editing project files, use standard Windows path syntax - they will be converted by xbuild, if necessary. One important caveat to this rule is case sensitivity - don't mix different casings of the same file name. If you have a project that does this, you can enable compatibility mode by invoking MONO_IOMAP=case xbuild foo.sln (or try MONO_IOMAP=all). Mono has a page describing more advanced MSBuild project porting techniques.

Mono 2.0 answer (2008): xbuild is not yet complete (it works quite well with VS2005 .csproj files, has problems with VS2008 .csproj and does not handle .sln). Mono 2.1 plans to merge the code base of mdtool (MonoDevelop command line build engine) into it, but currently mdtool is a better choice. mdtool build -f:project.sln or man mdtool if you have MonoDevelop installed.

I would say the extra work of saving the prepared statement in Product::getPrice_A is not typically very helpful, more because it can obscure the code rather than an issue of performance.  When dealing with performance, I feel it's always best to focus on code clarity and then performance when you have real statistics that indicate a problem.

I would say ""yes, the extra work is unnecessary"" (regardless of if it really boosts performance).  Also, I am not a very big DB expert, but the performance gain of prepared statements is something I heard from others, and it is at the database level, not the code level (so if the code is actually invoking a parameterized statement on the actual DB, then the DB can do these execution plan caching... though depending on the database, you may get the benefit even without the parameterized statement).

Anyways, if you are really worried about (and seeing) database performance issues, you should look into a caching solution... of which I would highly recommend memcached.  With such a solution, you can cache your query results and not even hit the database for things you access frequently.

            if count == 0:
                continue
            tiles[letter] = count - 1

def load_dictionary(path):
    result = Node()
    for line in open(path, 'r'):

        letters = raw_input('Enter letters: ')
        letters = letters.lower()

            count += 1

When you run the program, the words are loaded into a trie in memory.  After that, just type in the letters you want to search with and it will print the results.  It will only show results that use all of the input letters, nothing shorter.

It filters short words from the output, otherwise the number of results is huge.  Feel free to tweak the MIN_WORD_SIZE setting.  Keep in mind, just using ""astronomers"" as input gives 233,549 results if MIN_WORD_SIZE is 1.  Perhaps you can find a shorter word list that only contains more common English words.

Also, the contraction ""I'm"" (from one of your examples) won't show up in the results unless you add ""im"" to the dictionary and set MIN_WORD_SIZE to 2.

The trick to getting multiple words is to jump back to the root node in the trie whenever you encounter a complete word in the search.  Then you keep traversing the trie until all letters have been used.

First off, this only works on Palm OS 5 and is sketchy on some of the early Palm OS 5 devices.  The latest devices are better but not perfect.

Next, you will need to create an alarm for your application using AlmSetAlarm.  This is how you accomplish the ""every X minutes or hours"" part.

When the alarm fires, your application will get a sysAppLaunchCmdAlarmTriggered launch code, even if it's not already running.  If you only want to do something simple and quick, you can do it in response to the launch code and you're done.

After you do your stuff in the alarm launch code, be sure to set up the next alarm so that you continue to be called.

Important notes: You cannot access global variables when responding this launch code!  Depending on the setup in your compiler, you probably also won't be able to access certain C++ features, like virtual functions (which internally use global variables).  There is a setting you can set in Codewarrior that will help with this, but I'm not too familiar with it.  You should architect your code so that it doesn't need globals; for example, you can use FtrSet and FtrGet to store bits of global data that you might need.  Finally, you will only be able to access a single 64KB code segment of 68000 machine code.  Inter-segment jumps don't work properly without globals set up.

You can get around a lot of these restrictions by moving the majority of your code to a PNOlet, but that's an entirely different and more complicated topic.

If you want to do something more complicated that could take a while (e.g. load a web page or download email), it is strongly recommended not to do it during the alarm launch code.  You could do something in the sysAppLaunchCmdDisplayAlarm launch code and display a form to the user allowing them to cancel.  But this is bound to get annoying quickly.

Better for the user experience (but much more complicated) is to become a background application.  This is a bit of black magic and is not really well supported, but it is possible.  There are basically three steps to becoming a background application:


Protect your application database using DmDatabaseProtect.  This will ensure that your application is locked down so it can't be deleted.
Lock your code segment using MemHandleLock and MemHandleSetOwner (set the owner to 0).  This will ensure that your code is loaded into memory and won't be moved.
Register for some notifications.  For example, the sysNotifyIdleTimeEvent is a great notification to use to do some periodic background processing.


Once you set this up, you can exit from the alarm launch code and then wait for your notifications to fire.  You will then do all of your background processing when your notification handlers are called.

Also make sure that if you allocate any system objects (memory, handles, file handles, etc.), you set their owner to 0 (system) if you expect them to persist after you return from your notification handler.  Otherwise the system will clean them up.  If you do this, be super careful to avoid memory and resource leaks!!  They will never get cleaned up when the owner is set to 0!

To leave background mode, simply do the reverse: unregister for notifications, unlock your code segment, and unprotect your application database.

If you do any network operations in the background, be sure that you set the sockets to non-blocking mode and deal correctly with that!  Otherwise you will block the foreground application and cause problems.

Imagine you had SetWidth and SetHeight methods on your Rectangle base class; this seems perfectly logical. However if your Rectangle reference pointed to a Square, then SetWidth and SetHeight doesn't make sense because setting one would change the other to match it.

//* denote that a string was removed to prevent continual contraction
//of the string, unless this is what you want.
ABCBA*BbC*V*BC*AB
_ABCBA*BBC*V*BC*AB

RESULT:
ABCBA*B*C*V*BC*AB == ABCBABCVBCAB


This is of course starting with length=2, increase it to L/2 and iterate down. 

I'm also thinking of two other approaches:


digraph - Set a stateful digraph with the data and iterate over it with the string, if a cycle is found you'll have a duplication. I'm not sure how easy it is check check for these cycles... possibly some dynamic programming, so it could be equivlent to method 2 below. I'm going to have to think about this one as well longer.
distance matrix - using a levenstein distance matrix you might be able to detect duplication from diagonal movement (off the diagonal) with cost 0. This could indicate duplication of data. I will have to think about this more.

You can use revision if you prefer.

You then would have a ""FileUpdate"" tasks to edit the AssemblyInfo.cs file with that version, and your EXE's and ""DLL's"" will have the desired version.

Finally the VSSLabel task will label all your files appropriately.

For your ""Rebuild"" Build - you would modify your ""Get"" to get files from that Label, obviously not execute the ""Version"" task (as you are SELECTING a version to build) and then the FileUpdate tasks would use that version number.

2815,58450,6042.0,2008-09-12T07:30:04Z,58280,15,"Ok, Iâve done  a little more research into this now.
When you create a windows service in .Net, you create a class that inherits from System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase (In VB this is hidden in the .Designer.vb file). You then override the OnStart and OnStop function, and OnPause and OnContinue if you choose to. 
These methods are invoked from within the base class so I did a little poking around with reflector.
OnStart is invoked by a method in System.ServiceProcess.ServiceBase called ServiceQueuedMainCallback.  The vesion on my machine ""System.ServiceProcess, Version=2.0.0.0"" decompiles like this:



Private Sub ServiceQueuedMainCallback(ByVal state As Object)
    Dim args As String() = DirectCast(state, String())
    Try 
        Me.OnStart(args)
        Me.WriteEventLogEntry(Res.GetString(""StartSuccessful""))
        Me.status.checkPoint = 0
        Me.status.waitHint = 0
        Me.status.currentState = 4
    Catch exception As Exception
        Me.WriteEventLogEntry(Res.GetString(""StartFailed"", New Object() { exception.ToString }), EventLogEntryType.Error)
        Me.status.currentState = 1
    Catch obj1 As Object
        Me.WriteEventLogEntry(Res.GetString(""StartFailed"", New Object() { String.Empty }), EventLogEntryType.Error)
        Me.status.currentState = 1
    End Try
    Me.startCompletedSignal.Set
End Sub



So because Me.OnStart(args) is called from within the Try portion of a Try Catch block I assume that anything that happens within the OnStart method is effectively wrapped by that Try Catch block and therefore any exceptions that occur aren't technically unhandled as they are actually handled in the ServiceQueuedMainCallback Try Catch. So CurrentDomain.UnhandledException never actually happens at least during the startup routine. 
The other 3 entry points (OnStop, OnPause and OnContinue) are all called from the base class in a similar way.

So I âthinkâ that explains why my Exception Handling component canât catch UnhandledException on Start and Stop, but Iâm not sure if it explains why timers that are setup in OnStart canât cause an UnhandledException when they fire.

From T-SQL there is no way to access multiple results of a nested stored procedure call, without changing the stored procedure as others have suggested.

To be complete, if the procedure were returning a single result, you could insert it into a temp table or table variable with the following syntax:

INSERT INTO #Table (...columns...)
EXEC MySproc ...parameters...


You can use the same syntax for a procedure that returns multiple results, but it will only process the first result, the rest will be discarded.

Try following the execution plan of your SPROCS to ensure they are using the indexes you think they are.

Absolutely and brutally minimize the number of images you have that contain text. Doing so will make your life a billion percent easier since you won't have to get a new set of images for every friggin' language.
Be very wary of css positioning that relies on things always remaining the same size. If  those things contain text, they will not remain the same size, and you will then need to go back and fix your designs.
If you use character types in your sql tables, make sure that any of those that might receive international input are unicode (nchar, nvarchar, ntext). For that matter, I would just standardize on using the unicode versions.
If you're building SQL queries dynamically, make sure that you include the N prefix before any quoted text if there's any chance that text might be unicode. If you end up putting garbage in a SQL table, check to see if that's there.
Make sure that all your web pages definitively state that they are in a unicode format. See Joel's article, mentioned above.
You're going to be using resource files a lot for this project. That's good - ASP.NET 2.0 has great support for such. You'll want to look into the App_LocalResources and App_GlobalResources folder as well as GetLocalResourceObject, GetGlobalResourceObject, and the concept of meta:resourceKey. Chapter 30 of Professional ASP.NET 2.0 has some great content regarding that. The 3.5 version of the book may well have good content there as well, but I don't own it.
Think about fonts. Many of the standard fonts you might want to use aren't unicode capable. I've always had luck with Arial Unicode MS, MS Gothic, MS Mincho. I'm not sure about how cross-platform these are, though. Also, note that not all fonts support all of the Unicode character definition. Again, test, test, test.
Start thinking now about how you're going to get translations into this system. Go talk to whoever is your translation vendor about how they want data passed back and forth for translation. Think about the fact that, through your local resource files, you will likely be repeating some commonly used strings through the system. Do you normalize those into global resource files, or do you have some sort of database layer where only one copy of each text used is generated. In our recent project, we used resource files which were generated from a database table that contained all the translations and the original, english version of the resource files. 
Test. Generally speaking I will test in German, Polish, and an Asian language (Japanese, Chinese, Korean). German and Polish are wordy and nearly guaranteed to stretch text areas, Asian languages use an entirely different set of characters which tests your unicode support.

  I believe that CAPTCHA is dying. If someone really wants to break it, it will be broken. I read (somewhere, don't remember where) about a site that gave you free porn in exchange for answering CAPTCHAs to they can be rendered obsolete by bots. So, why bother?


Anyone who really wants to break this padlock can use a pair of bolt cutters, so why bother with the lock?
Anyone who really wants to steal this car can drive up with a tow truck, so why bother locking my car?
Anyone who really wants to open this safe can cut it open with an oxyacetylene torch, so why bother putting things in the safe?

Because using the padlock, locking your car, putting valuables in a safe, and using a CAPTCHA weeds out a large spectrum of relatively unsophisticated or unmotivated attackers.  The fact that it doesn't stop sophisticated, highly motivated attackers doesn't mean that it doesn't work at all.  Using a CAPTCHA isn't going to stop all spammers, but it's going to tremendously reduce the amount that requires filtering or manual intervention.  

Heck look at the lame CAPTCHA that Jeff uses on his blog.  Even a wimpy barrier like that still provides a lot of protection.

  When should the lock be used?


A lock should be used to protect shared resources in multithreaded code.  Not for anything else.


  But is it necessary when the application does not spin off any other threads?


Absolutely not.  It's just a time waster.  However do be sure that you're not implicitly using system threads.  For example if you use asynchronous I/O you may receive callbacks from a random thread, not your original thread.


  Is there performance issues with using lock?


Yes.  They're not very big in a single-threaded application, but why make calls you don't need?


  ...if that is a good design pattern to follow in the future[?]


Locking everything willy-nilly is a terrible design pattern.  If your code is cluttered with random locking and then you do decide to use a background thread for some work, you're likely to run into deadlocks.  Sharing a resource between multiple threads requires careful design, and the more you can isolate the tricky part, the better.

Hopefully the following example illustrates the correct usage. For a more complete example checkout the MSDN docs on Using OPENXML.

declare @XmlDocumentHandle int
declare @XmlDocument nvarchar(1000)
set @XmlDocument = N'<ROOT>
<Customer>
   <FirstName>Will</FirstName>
   <LastName>Smith</LastName>
</Customer>
</ROOT>'

-- Create temp table to insert data into
create table #Customer 
( 
    FirstName varchar(20),
    LastName varchar(20) 
)
-- Create an internal representation of the XML document.
exec sp_xml_preparedocument @XmlDocumentHandle output, @XmlDocument

-- Insert using openxml allows us to read the structure
insert into #Customer
select 
    FirstName = XmlFirstName,
    LastName = XmlLastName
from openxml ( @XmlDocumentHandle, '/ROOT/Customer',2 )
with 
(
    XmlFirstName  varchar(20) 'FirstName',
    XmlLastName varchar(20) 'LastName'

where ( XmlFirstName = 'Will' and XmlLastName = 'Smith' )

-- Cleanup xml document
exec sp_xml_removedocument @XmlDocumentHandle

-- Show the data
select * 
from #Customer

-- Drop tmp table
drop table #Customer


If you have an xml file and are using C#, then defining a stored procedure that does something like the above and then passing the entire xml file contents to the stored procedure as a string should give you a fairly straight forward way of importing xml into your existing table(s).

  NOTE that this is a general look at stored procedures not regulated to a specific
  DBMS. Some DBMS (and even, different
  versions of the same DBMS!) may operate
  contrary to this, so you'll want to
  double-check with your target DBMS
  before assuming all of this still holds.
  
  I've been a Sybase ASE, MySQL, and SQL Server DBA on-and off since for almost a decade (along with application development in C, PHP, PL/SQL, C#.NET, and Ruby). So, I have no particular axe to grind in this (sometimes) holy war.


The historical performance benefit of stored procs have generally been from the following (in no particular order):


Pre-parsed SQL
Pre-generated query execution plan
Reduced network latency
Potential cache benefits


Pre-parsed SQL -- similar benefits to compiled vs. interpreted code, except on a very micro level. 

Still an advantage? 
Not very noticeable at all on the modern CPU, but if you are sending a single SQL statement that is VERY large eleventy-billion times a second, the parsing overhead can add up.

Pre-generated query execution plan. 
If you have many JOINs the permutations can grow quite unmanageable (modern optimizers have limits and cut-offs for performance reasons). It is not unknown for very complicated SQL to have distinct, measurable (I've seen a complicated query take 10+ seconds just to generate a plan, before we tweaked the DBMS) latencies due to the optimizer trying to figure out the ""near best"" execution plan. Stored procedures will, generally, store this in memory so you can avoid this overhead.

Still an advantage? 
Most DBMS' (the latest editions) will cache the query plans for INDIVIDUAL SQL statements, greatly reducing the performance differential between stored procs and ad hoc SQL. There are some caveats and cases in which this isn't the case, so you'll need to test on your target DBMS.

Also, more and more DBMS allow you to provide optimizer path plans (abstract query plans) to significantly reduce optimization time (for both ad hoc and stored procedure SQL!!).


  WARNING Cached query plans are not a performance panacea. Occasionally the query plan that is generated is sub-optimal.
  For example, if you send SELECT *
  FROM table WHERE id BETWEEN 1 AND
  99999999, the DBMS may select a
  full-table scan instead of an index
  scan because you're grabbing every row
  in the table (so sayeth the
  statistics). If this is the cached
  version, then you can get poor
  performance when you later send
  SELECT * FROM table WHERE id BETWEEN
  1 AND 2. The reasoning behind this is
  outside the scope of this posting, but
  for further reading see:
  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sql/2005/frcqupln.mspx
  and
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms181055.aspx
  and http://www.simple-talk.com/sql/performance/execution-plan-basics/
  
  ""In summary, they determined that
  supplying anything other than the
  common values when a compile or
  recompile was performed resulted in
  the optimizer compiling and caching
  the query plan for that particular
  value. Yet, when that query plan was
  reused for subsequent executions of
  the same query for the common values
  (âMâ, âRâ, or âTâ), it resulted in
  sub-optimal performance. This
  sub-optimal performance problem
  existed until the query was
  recompiled. At that point, based on
  the @P1 parameter value supplied, the
  query might or might not have a
  performance problem.""


Reduced network latency
A) If you are running the same SQL over and over -- and the SQL adds up to many KB of code -- replacing that with a simple ""exec foobar"" can really add up.
B) Stored procs can be used to move procedural code into the DBMS. This saves shuffling large amounts of data off to the client only to have it send a trickle of info back (or none at all!). Analogous to doing a JOIN in the DBMS vs. in your code (everyone's favorite WTF!)

Still an advantage?
A) Modern 1Gb (and 10Gb and up!) Ethernet really make this negligible. 
B) Depends on how saturated your network is -- why shove several megabytes of data back and forth for no good reason?

Potential cache benefits
Performing server-side transforms of data can potentially be faster if you have sufficient memory on the DBMS and the data you need is in memory of the server.

Still an advantage?
Unless your app has shared memory access to DBMS data, the edge will always be to stored procs.

Of course, no discussion of Stored Procedure optimization would be complete without a discussion of parameterized and ad hoc SQL.

Parameterized / Prepared SQL
Kind of a cross between stored procedures and ad hoc SQL, they are embedded SQL statements in a host language that uses ""parameters"" for query values, e.g.:

SELECT .. FROM yourtable WHERE foo = ? AND bar = ?


These provide a more generalized version of a query that modern-day optimizers can use to cache (and re-use) the query execution plan, resulting in much of the performance benefit of stored procedures.

Ad Hoc SQL
Just open a console window to your DBMS and type in a SQL statement. In the past, these were the ""worst"" performers (on average) since the DBMS had no way of pre-optimizing the queries as in the parameterized/stored proc method.

Still a disadvantage?
Not necessarily. Most DBMS have the ability to ""abstract"" ad hoc SQL into parameterized versions -- thus more or less negating the difference between the two. Some do this implicitly or must be enabled with a command setting (SQL server: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms175037.aspx , Oracle: http://www.praetoriate.com/oracle_tips_cursor_sharing.htm).

Lessons learned?
Moore's law continues to march on and DBMS optimizers, with every release, get more sophisticated. Sure, you can place every single silly teeny SQL statement inside a stored proc, but just know that the programmers working on optimizers are very smart and are continually looking for ways to improve performance. Eventually (if it's not here already) ad hoc SQL performance will become indistinguishable (on average!) from stored procedure performance, so any sort of massive stored procedure use ** solely for ""performance reasons""** sure sounds like premature optimization to me.

Anyway, I think if you avoid the edge cases and have fairly vanilla SQL, you won't notice a difference between ad hoc and stored procedures.

158080,2688631,90527.0,2010-04-22T06:25:21Z,60000,26,"C++03 std, Â§4.11 2 Pointer to member conversions:


  An rvalue of type âpointer to member of B of type cv T,â where B is a class type, can be converted to an rvalue of type âpointer to member of D of type cv T,â where D is a derived class (clause 10) of B. If B is an inaccessible (clause 11), ambiguous (10.2) or virtual (10.1) base class of D, a program that necessitates this conversion is ill-formed. The result of the conversion refers to the same member as the pointer to member before the conversion took place, but it refers to the base class member as if it were a member of the derived class. The result refers to the member in Dâs instance of B. Since the result has type âpointer to member of D of type cv T,â it can be dereferenced with a D object. The result is the same as if the pointer to member of B were dereferenced with the B sub-object of D.   The null member pointer value is converted to the null member pointer value of the destination type. 52)
  
  52)The rule for conversion of pointers to members (from pointer to member of base to pointer to member of derived) appears inverted compared to the rule for pointers to objects (from pointer to derived to pointer to base) (4.10, clause 10). This inversion is necessary to ensure type safety. Note that a pointer to member is not a pointer to object or a pointer to function and the rules for conversions of such pointers do not apply to pointers to members. In particular, a pointer to member cannot be converted to a void*.


In short, you can convert a pointer to a member of an accessible, non-virtual base class to a pointer to a member of a derived class as long as the member isn't ambiguous. 

class A {
public: 
    void foo();
};
class B : public A {};
class C {
public:
    void bar();
};
class D {
public:
    void baz();
};
class E : public A, public B, private C, public virtual D {
public: 
    typedef void (E::*member)();
};
class F:public E {
public:
    void bam();
};
...
int main() {
   E::member mbr;
   mbr = &A::foo; // invalid: ambiguous; E's A or B's A?
   mbr = &C::bar; // invalid: C is private 
   mbr = &D::baz; // invalid: D is virtual
   mbr = &F::bam; // invalid: conversion isn't defined by the standard
   ...


Conversion in the other direction (via static_cast) is governed by Â§ 5.2.9 9:


  An rvalue of type ""pointer to member of D of type cv1 T"" can be converted to an rvalue of type ""pointer to member of B of type cv2 T"", where B is a base class (clause 10 class.derived) of D, if a valid standard conversion from ""pointer to member of B of type T"" to ""pointer to member of D of type T"" exists (4.11 conv.mem), and cv2 is the same cv-qualification as, or greater cv-qualification than, cv1.11) The null member pointer value (4.11 conv.mem) is converted to the null member pointer value of the destination type. If class B contains the original member, or is a base or derived class of the class containing the original member, the resulting pointer to member points to the original member.  Otherwise, the result of the cast is undefined. [Note: although class B need not contain the original member, the dynamic type of the object on which the pointer to member is dereferenced must contain the original member; see 5.5 expr.mptr.oper.]
  
  11) Function types (including those used in pointer to member function
    types) are never cv-qualified; see 8.3.5 dcl.fct.


In short, you can convert from a derived D::* to a base B::* if you can convert from a B::* to a D::*, though you can only use the B::* on objects that are of type D or are descended from D.

Wikipedia has an interesting definition:


  A tag cloud or word cloud (or weighted list in visual design) is a visual depiction of user-generated tags, or simply the word content of a site, used typically to describe the content of web sites. Tags are usually single words and are typically listed alphabetically, and the importance of a tag is shown with font size or color. [1] Thus both finding a tag by alphabet and by popularity is possible. The tags are usually hyperlinks that lead to a collection of items that are associated with a tag.

It's also known as the Cheshire Cat because of Lewis Caroll's character that fades away until only the grin remains.

The example code should be distributed across two sets of source files. Then only Cat.h is the file that is shipped with the product.

CatImpl.h is included by Cat.cpp and CatImpl.cpp contains the implementation for CatImpl::Purr(). This won't be visible to the public using your product.

Basically the idea is to hide as much as possible of the implementation fom prying eyes.
This is most useful where you have a commercial product that is shipped as a series of libraries that are accessed via an API that the customer's code is compiled against and linked to.

We did this with the rewrite of IONAs Orbix 3.3 product in 2000.

As mentioned by others, using his technique completely decouples the implementation from the interface of the object. Then you won't have to recompile everything that uses Cat if you just want to change the implementation of Purr().

This technique is used in a methodology called design by contract.

The main drawback to inline functions is that it can increase the size of your executable (depending on the number of instantiations).  This can be a problem on some platforms (eg. embedded systems), especially if the function itself is recursive.

I'd also recommend making inline'd functions very small - The speed benefits of inline functions tend to diminish as the function grows in size. At some point the overhead of the function call becomes small compared to the execution of the function body, and the benefit is lost.

Latest versions of ConEmu may set up itself as default terminal for Windows
Use any font installed in the system, or copied to a folder of the program (ttf, otf, fon, bdf)
Run selected tabs as Administrator (Vista+) or as selected user
Windows 7 Jump lists and Progress on taskbar
Integration with DosBox (useful in 64bit systems to run DOS applications)
Smooth resize, maximized and fullscreen window modes
Scrollbar initially hidden, may be revealed by mouseover or checkbox in settings
Optional settings (e.g. pallette) for selected applications
User friendly text and block selection (from keyboard or mouse), copy, paste, text search in console
ANSI X3.64 and Xterm 256 color


Far Manager users will acquire shell style drag-n-drop, thumbnails and tiles in panles, tabs for editors and viewers, true colors and font styles (italic/bold/underline).

Grouping of history

When I'm browsing the history of a branch instead of just seeing a bunch of rows for every commit it can group commits by today, week, etc.

Mapping of trunk, branches, and tags

Subversive assumes the default svn layout: trunk, branches, tags (which you can change), so whenever you want to tag or branch it is one click and you provide the name of the tag or branch.

Like I said these are minor differences that I just find convenient. Both work great with mylyn, but overall there really isn't a whole lot of differences with these two extensions.

Merging with Subversive is a pain though (haven't tried Subclipse), I've never been able to successfully merge. The preview of the merge is great but it would never complete the merge or it will take way to long. Most of the time I complete merging through the command line without any issues.

Good Tests should be A TRIP (The acronymn isn't sticky enough - I have a printout of the cheatsheet in the book that I had to pull out to make sure I got this right..)


Automatic : Invoking of tests as well as checking results for PASS/FAIL should be automatic
Thorough: Coverage; Although bugs tend to cluster around certain regions in the code, ensure that you test all key paths and scenarios.. Use tools if you must to know untested regions
Repeatable: Tests should produce the same results each time.. every time. Tests should not rely on uncontrollable params.
Independent: Very important. 

Tests should test only one thing at a time. Multiple assertions are okay as long as they are all testing one feature/behavior. When a test fails, it should pinpoint the location of the problem.
Tests should not rely on each other - Isolated. No assumptions about order of test execution. Ensure 'clean slate' before each test by using setup/teardown appropriately

Professional: In the long run you'll have as much test code as production (if not more), therefore follow the same standard of good-design for your test code. Well factored methods-classes with intention-revealing names, No duplication, tests with good names, etc. 
Good tests also run Fast. any test that takes over half a second to run.. needs to be worked upon. The longer the test suite takes for a run.. the less frequently it will be run. The more changes the dev will try to sneak between runs.. if anything breaks.. it will take longer to figure out which change was the culprit.


Update 2010-08:


Readable : This can be considered part of Professional - however it can't be stressed enough. An acid test would be to find someone who isn't part of your team and asking him/her to figure out the behavior under test within a couple of minutes. Tests need to be maintained just like production code - so make it easy to read even if it takes more effort. Tests should be symmetric (follow a pattern) and concise (test one behavior at a time). Use a consistent naming convention (e.g. the TestDox style). Avoid cluttering the test with ""incidental details"".. become a minimalist.


Apart from these, most of the others are guidelines that cut down on low-benefit work: e.g. 'Don't test code that you don't own' (e.g. third-party DLLs). Don't go about testing getters and setters. Keep an eye on cost-to-benefit ratio or defect probability.

If you want to access the private member that these properties use, that's usually for a few reasons:


You need to more than just a simple get/set - in this case, you should just avoid using automatic properties for this member.
You want to avoid the performance hit of going through the get or set and just use the member directly - in this case, I'd be surprised if there really was a performance hit. The simple get/set members are very very easy to inline, and in my (admittedly limited) testing I haven't found a difference between using the automatic properties and accessing the member directly. 
You only want to have public read access (i.e. just a 'get') and the class write to the member directly - in this case, you can use a private set in your automatic property. i.e.

public class MyClass
{
    public int Age {get; private set;}

Therefore, once you call pop_back, any iterators to the previously final element (which now no longer exists) are invalidated.

3212,63406,,2008-09-15T14:28:59Z,63100,7,"In general testers and documenters (and other non-developes)  are all equal members of a scrum team. The idea behind that is to minimize risk. 

Requiring a definition of done, which includes a potentially shipable product that's fully tested and documented, forces the project to come together at the end of each sprint.

If testing does not start until AFTER dev. is done, what happens is that a lot of bugs are discovered after the developers are done with a task. So now you have to fix those bugs, and that's very slow and expensive both because bugs interact and because the general rule is: ""The expense of fixing a bug grows exponentially with time.""  Bugs you catch early are cheap and easy to fix, late bugs are a nightmare.

That is why you want testing (and documentation) to move in step with development. And right now you should be asking, how! Testing is slow, how the heck can it move in step with dev? 

The answer is automation, that is SCRUM always sits on top of XP or Agile, both demand excellent unit test coverage and TDD. Here's another gotcha to watch out for. The features developers should be the ones writing both, unit and system test. All testing automation should be done by the feature dev. team. Some places split feature dev. from automation dev. and that's bad.

OK, so now you have great automated testing and you run it AT LEAST once a day. And obviously you practice continuous integration right? This reduces the work load of the testers by a huge amount. And that's how testing can stay in step with dev. One more thing, the testers now work on the really hard and creative stuff that's impossible or very difficult to automate, every time they find a bug that way, what ever it took to expose the bug is automated and becomes part of the daily regression tests. Phew, that's a long answer!

Now to the second part of your question. Scrum is about discipline.  Sprints are short and backlog changes during a sprint should NOT happen. Non technical work should be branched of onto a customer support team and they can do Scrum around that. You're right when you say that is sounds like your culture and practices are incompatible with scrum.

In my experience transitioning to Scrum/Agile is a very painful, stressful process and most attempts to transition fail. One of the key's to success is a champion for Scrum/Agile in the executive team. From your description it sounds like you don't have one.  

There are costs and benefits to Scrum, but you're doing it badly you might be incurring costs with little or no benefit.  If you're doing Scrum wrong and badly, you might be better off not doing Scrum at all.

env TERM=xterm-256color emacs -nw

Both Emacs and system copy usually work with X paste.

I think this is pretty standard modern Unix behavior.

It's also important to note (though you say you're using Emacs in a separate window) that when Emacs is running in a console, it is completely divorced from the system and X clipboards: cut and paste in that case is mediated by the terminal. For example, ""Edit->Paste"" in your terminal window should act exactly as if you typed the text from the clipboard into the Emacs buffer.

Create a new project in XCode. I think I used the view-based app.
Drag a WebView object onto your interface and resize.
Inside of your WebViewController.m (or similarly named file, depending on the name of your view), in the viewDidLoad method:

NSString *filePath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@""index"" ofType:@""html""];  
NSData *htmlData = [NSData dataWithContentsOfFile:filePath];  
if (htmlData) {  
  NSBundle *bundle = [NSBundle mainBundle];

  NSString *fullPath = [NSBundle pathForResource:@""index"" ofType:@""html"" inDirectory:path];
  [webView loadRequest:[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:[NSURL fileURLWithPath:fullPath]]];

Now any files you have added as resources to the project are available for use in your web app. I've got an index.html file including javascript and css and image files with no problems. The only limitation I've found so far is that I can't create new folders so all the files clutter up the resources folder.
Trick: make sure you've added the file as a resource in XCode or the file won't be available. I've been adding an empty file in XCode, then dragging my file on top in the finder. That's been working for me.


Note: I realize that Obj-C must not be that hard to learn. But since I already have this app existing in JS and I know it works in Safari this is a much faster dev cycle for me. Some day I'm sure I'll have to break down and learn Obj-C.

Under ""Targets"" in the graphical tree display of your project, right click on your Target and do ""Get Info.""  Look for a property named ""Generate Debug Symbols"" (or similar) and make sure this is CHECKED (aka ON).  Also, you might try finding (also in Target >> Get Info) a property called ""Debug Information Format"" and setting it to ""Dwarf with dsym file.""


There are a number of other properties under Target >> Get Info that might affect you.  Look for things like optimizing or compressing code and turn that stuff OFF (I assume you are working in a debug mode, so that this is not bad advice).  Also, look for things like stripping symbols and make sure that is also OFF. For example, ""Strip Linked Product"" should be set to ""No"" for the Debug target.

Use JNI and crash in the native code.
If no security manager is installed you can use reflection to crash the VM. This is VM specific, but normally a VM stores a bunch of pointers to native resources in private fields (e.g. a pointer to the native thread object is stored in a long field in java.lang.Thread). Just change them via reflection and the VM will crash sooner or later.
All VMs have bugs, so you just have to trigger one.


For the last method I have a short example, which will crash a Sun Hotspot VM quiet nicely:

public class Crash {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object[] o = null;

        while (true) {
            o = new Object[] {o};

This leads to a stack overflow in the GC so you will get no StackOverflowError but a real crash including a hs_err* file.

Depending on how many standard library functions your runtime has, you may or not be able to use one of those.


  AceUnit
  
  AceUnit (Advanced C and Embedded Unit) bills itself as a comfortable C code unit test framework. It tries to mimick JUnit 4.x and includes reflection-like capabilities. AceUnit can be used in resource constraint environments, e.g. embedded software development, and importantly it runs fine in environments where you cannot include a single standard header file and cannot invoke a single standard C function from the ANSI / ISO C libraries. It also has a Windows port. It does not use forks to trap signals, although the authors have expressed interest in adding such a feature. See the AceUnit homepage.
  
  GNU Autounit
  
  Much along the same lines as Check, including forking to run unit tests in a separate address space (in fact, the original author of Check borrowed the idea from GNU Autounit). GNU Autounit uses GLib extensively, which means that linking and such need special options, but this may not be a big problem to you, especially if you are already using GTK or GLib. See the GNU Autounit homepage.
  
  cUnit
  
  Also uses GLib, but does not fork to protect the address space of unit tests.
  
  CUnit
  
  Standard C, with plans for a Win32 GUI implementation. Does not currently fork or otherwise protect the address space of unit tests. In early development. See the CUnit homepage.
  
  CuTest
  
  A simple framework with just one .c and one .h file that you drop into your source tree. See the CuTest homepage.
  
  CppUnit
  
  The premier unit testing framework for C++; you can also use it to test C code. It is stable, actively developed, and has a GUI interface. The primary reasons not to use CppUnit for C are first that it is quite big, and second you have to write your tests in C++, which means you need a C++ compiler. If these donât sound like concerns, it is definitely worth considering, along with other C++ unit testing frameworks. See the CppUnit homepage.
  
  embUnit
  
  embUnit (Embedded Unit) is another unit test framework for embedded systems. This one appears to be superseded by AceUnit. Embedded Unit homepage.
  
  MinUnit
  
  A minimal set of macros and thatâs it! The point is to show how easy it is to unit test your code. See the MinUnit homepage.
  
  CUnit for Mr. Ando
  
  A CUnit implementation that is fairly new, and apparently still in early development. See the CUnit for Mr. Ando homepage.
  
  This list was last updated in March 2008.


Others:

CMocka

CMocka is a test framework for C with support for mock objects. It's easy to use and setup. CMocka official homepage.

Criterion

Criterion is a cross-platform C unit testing framework supporting automatic test registration, parameterized tests, theories, and that can output to multiple formats, including TAP and JUnit XML. Each test is run in its own process, so signals and crashes can be reported or tested if needed. See the Criterion homepage for more information.

HWUT

HWUT is a general Unit Test tool with great support for C. It can help to create Makefiles, generate massive test cases coded in minimal 'iteration tables', walk along state machines, generate C-stubs and more. The general approach is pretty unique: Verdicts are based on 'good stdout/bad stdout'. The comparison function, though, is flexible. Thus, any type of script may be used for checking. It may be applied to any language that can produce standard output. See HWUT homepage.

There are a few quirks - for example, OpenGL is always double buffered on OS X, so we have to draw everything twice, once for the current frame and again for the other frame, since they are flipped whenever the display refreshes. You can look at our current progress in this subversion repository. (Splatterboard.py in trunk is the file you'll want to run.) If you're not up on using svn, I would be happy to email you a .zip of the latest source. Feel free to steal code if you look into it.

In my case I had a tabcontrol on a different coloured background. The tabs themselves were grey which wasn't a problem, but the area to the right of the tabs was displaying as a grey strip. 

To change this colour to the colour of your background you need to add the following code to the DrawItem method (as described in Rajesh's solution). I'm using VB.Net:

...

Dim r As Rectangle = tabControl1.GetTabRect(tabControl1.TabPages.Count-1)
Dim rf As RectangleF = New RectangleF(r.X + r.Width, r.Y - 5, tabControl1.Width - (r.X + r.Width), r.Height + 5)
Dim b As Brush = New SolidBrush(Color.White)
e.Graphics.FillRectangle(b, rf)

...


Basically you need to get the rectangle made of the right hand side of the last tab to the right hand side of the tab control and then fill it to your desired colour.

Python makes this very easy: timeit is your friend.

10000000 loops, best of 3: 0.0388 usec per loop

$ python -m timeit ""x=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]""
1000000 loops, best of 3: 0.363 usec per loop

$ python -m timeit -s ""x=(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)"" ""y=x[3]""
10000000 loops, best of 3: 0.0938 usec per loop

10000000 loops, best of 3: 0.0649 usec per loop


So in this case, instantiation is almost an order of magnitude faster for the tuple, but item access is actually somewhat faster for the list! So if you're creating a few tuples and accessing them many many times, it may actually be faster to use lists instead.

Of course if you want to change an item, the list will definitely be faster since you'd need to create an entire new tuple to change one item of it (since tuples are immutable).

Instructions for Setting up a development machine is another good one. Source Control server settings, Installation paths for tools used.

""Here the dragons lie"" - any known minefields with products (esp. legacy), 'Don't tread here' areas that you need to be careful while changing.. e.g. If you change something here, make sure you have it reviewed by Y and Z before checking in.
Update from Dimarzionist: Stash away decisions taken during development, reasons and supporting evidence (mail chains) if needed in a 'well-known place'


Core Metric: If you find no one on the team complaining ""WTH? Why didnt anyone document this? I'm stuck.. How am I supposed to proceed on this?"" - you're good.


If the team finds that they have been drawing a class diagram or sequence diagram over and over, that's proof that it is a useful artifact. Soon someone will make a sticky copy and save it somewhere to save time. Over time , the more useful artifacts would build up.

3579,69252,10703.0,2008-09-16T03:51:20Z,69250,25,"Without any optimization on, the flow through your code is linear.  If you are on line 5 and single step, you step to line 6.  With optimization on, you can get instruction re-ordering, loop unrolling and all sorts of optimizations.
For example:


void foo() {
1:  int i;
2:  for(i = 0; i &lt 2; )
3:    i++;
4:  return;


In this example, without optimization, you could single step through the code and hit lines 1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4

With optimization on, you might get an execution path that looks like: 2, 3, 3, 4 or even just 4! (The function does nothing after all...)

Bottom line, debugging code with optimization enabled can be a royal pain! Especially if you have large functions.

Note that turning on optimization changes the code! In certain environment (safety critical systems), this is unacceptable and the code being debugged has to be the code shipped. Gotta debug with optimization on in that case.

While the optimized and non-optimized code should be ""functionally"" equivalent, under certain circumstances, the behavior will change.
Here is a simplistic example:

    int* ptr = 0xdeadbeef;  // some address to memory-mapped I/O device
    *ptr = 0;   // setup hardware device
    while(*ptr == 1) {    // loop until hardware device is done
       // do something
    }


With optimization off, this is straightforward, and you kinda know what to expect.
However, if you turn optimization on, a couple of things might happen:


The compiler might optimize the while block away (we init to 0, it'll never be 1)
Instead of accessing memory, pointer access might be moved to a register->No I/O Update
memory access might be cached (not necessarily compiler optimization related)


In all these cases, the behavior would be drastically different and most likely wrong.

  Cryptography is not the solution to your security problems. It might be part of the solution, or it might be part of the problem. In many situations, cryptography starts out by making the problem worse, and it isn't at all clear that using cryptography is an improvement.


Essentially encrypting your emails in the database 'just in case' is not really making the database more secure. Where are the keys stored for the database? What file permissions are used for these keys? Is the database accesable publically? Why? What kind of account restrictions are in place for these accounts? Where is the machine stored, who has physical access to this box? What about remote login/ssh access etc. etc. etc.

So I guess you can encrypt the emails if you want, but if that is the extent of the security of the system then it really isn't doing much, and would actually make the job of maintaining the database harder.

Of course this could be part of an extensive security policy for your system - if so then great!

I'm not saying that it is a bad idea - But why have a lock on the door from Deadlocks'R'us which cost $5000 when they can cut through the plywood around the door? Or come in through the window which you left open? Or even worse they find the key which was left under the doormat. Security of a system is only as good as the weakest link. If they have root access then they can pretty much do what they want.

Steve Morgan makes a good point that even if they cannot understand the email addresses, they can still do a lot of harm (which could be mitigated if they only had SELECT access)

Its also important to know what your reasons are for storing the email address at all. I might have gone a bit overboard with this answer, but my point is do you really need to store an email address for an account? The most secure data is data that doesn't exist.

As you guessed, first you count how many times words appear in the text (usually called document in the NLP-lingo). Then you throw out the so called stop words, such as ""the"", ""a"", ""or"" and so on.

You're left with words and word counts. Do this for a while and you get a comprehensive set of words that appear in your documents. You can then create an index for these words:
""aardvark"" is 1, ""apple"" is 2, ..., ""z-index"" is 70092. 

Now you can take your word bags and turn them into vectors. For example, if your document contains two references for aardvarks and nothing else, it would look like this:

[2 0 0 ... 70k zeroes ... 0].


After this you can count the ""angle"" between the two vectors with a dot product. The smaller the angle, the closer the documents are.

This is a simple version and there other more advanced techniques. May the Wikipedia be with you.

For example - in very rough pseudo-code:

download.php

$file = $_GET['file'];
updateFileCount($file);
header('Content-Type: image/jpeg');
sendFile($file);


Then, you just have your download link point to download.php instead of the actual file. (Note that updateFileCount and sendFile are functions that you would have to provide, of course - this script is an example of a download script which you could use)

Note: I highly recommend avoiding the use of $_GET['file'] to get the whole filename - malicious users could use it to retrieve sensitive files from your web server. But the safe use of PHP downloads is a topic for another question.

So the answer is you use D3DTS_VIEW to set up matrices that should apply to your lights, and D3DTS_WORLD to set up matrices that apply to the placement of your geometry in the world.

So actually the D3D system kinda makes more sense than the OpenGL way.  It allows you to specify your light positions whenever and wherever the heck you feel like it once and for all, without having to constantly reposition them so that they get transformed by your  current ""view"" transform.  OpenGL has to work that way because it simply doesn't know what you think your ""view"" is vs your ""model"".  It's all just a modelview to GL.

(Comment - apologies if I'm not supposed to answer my own questions here, but this was a real question that I had a few weeks ago and thought it was worth posting here to help others making the shift from OpenGL to D3D.

A BSTR type is a pointer to a null-terminated wchar_t array already. In fact, if you check the headers, you will find that BSTR is essentially defined as:

typedef BSTR wchar_t*;


So, the compiler can't distinguish between them, even though they have different semantics.

There is are two important caveat.


BSTRs are supposed to be immutable. You should never change the contents of a BSTR after it has been initialized. If you ""change it"", you have to create a new one assign the new pointer and release the old one (if you own it).
[UPDATE: this is not true; sorry! You can modify BSTRs in place; I very rarely have had the need.]
BSTRs are allowed to contain embedded null characters, whereas traditional C/C++ strings are not.


If you have a fair amount of control of the source of the BSTR, and can guarantee that the BSTR does not have embedded NULLs, you can read from the BSTR as if it was a wchar_t and use conventional string methods (wcscpy, etc) to access it. If not, your life gets harder. You will have to always manipulate your data as either more BSTRs, or as a dynamically-allocated array of wchar_t. Most string-related functions will not work correctly.

Let's assume you control your data, or don't worry about NULLs. Let's assume also that you really need to make a copy and can't just read the existing BSTR directly. In that case, you can do something like this:

UINT length = SysStringLen(myBstr);        // Ask COM for the size of the BSTR
wchar_t *myString = new wchar_t[lenght+1]; // Note: SysStringLen doesn't 
                                           // include the space needed for the NULL

wcscpy(myString, myBstr);                  // Or your favorite safer string function

// ...

delete myString; // Done


If you are using class wrappers for your BSTR, the wrapper should have a way to call SysStringLen() for you. For example:

CComBString    use .Length();
_bstr_t        use .length();


UPDATE: This is a good article on the subject by someone far more knowledgeable than me:

Make the callable orchestrations use a direct-bound port attached to your activating receive shape.
Set up a filter expression on your activating receive shape with a custom context-based property and set it equal to a value that uniquely identifies the orchestration (such as the orchestration name or whatever)
In the calling orchestration, create the message you'll want to use to fire the new orchestration. In that message, set your custom context property to the value that matches the filter used in the specific orchestration you want to fire.
Send the message through a direct-bound send port so that it gets sent to the MsgBox directly and the Pub/Sub mechanisms in BizTalk will take care of the rest.


One thing to watch out in step 4: To have this work correctly, you will need to create a new Correlation Set type that includes your custom context property, and then make sure that the direct-bound send port ""follows"" the correlation set on the send. Otherwise, the custom property will only be written (and not promoted) to the msg context and the routing will fail.

An example foo.desktop file would be:

[Desktop Entry]
Encoding=UTF-8
GenericName=Generic Piece Of Software
Name=FooBar
Exec=/usr/bin/foo.sh
Icon=foo.png
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Qt;Gnome;Applications;


The .desktop file should under Fedora 9 Gnome be located in /usr/share/applications/ , you can run a locate on .desktop to figure out where you should put in on your distro.  Gnome will generally look in the KDE icon directory to see if there are other icons there also....


  Encoding, Name and Exec should speak for themselves.
  
  
  Generic name == Brief Description of application.
  Icon == The image to display for the icon
  Terminal == Is this a terminal application, should I start it as one?
  Type == Type of program this is, can be used in placing the icon in a menu.
  Categories == This information is what is mainly used to place the icon in a given menu if an XML file to specify such is not present.  The setup for menus is handled a little differently by everyone.
  


There are more attributes you can set, but they aren't strictly necessary.

The image file used sits somewhere in the bowels of the /usr/share/icons/ directory.  You can parse through that to find all the wonders of how such things work, but the basics are that you pick the directory for the icon type (in my case gnome) and place the image within the appropriate directory (there is a scalable directory for .svg images, and specific sizes such as 48x48 for raster images.  Under Gnome all images are generally .png).

Example

SELECT col INTO var FROM table WHERE something;


An explicit cursor is one you create yourself. It takes more code, but gives more control - for example, you can just open-fetch-close if you only want the first record and don't care if there are others.

    createOMNamespace(""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"", ""xsi"");

SOAPEnvelope envelope = fac.getDefaultEnvelope();
OMNamespace xsi = fac.createOMNamespace(""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"", ""xsi"");

If your use-cases never require updates to both databases within the same transaction, then you can use two JpaTransactionManagers, but I'm not sure you will be able to use the @Transactional approach? In this case, you would need to fallback on the older mechanism of using a simple TransactionProxyFactoryBean to define transaction boundaries, eg:

<bean id=""firstRealService"" class=""com.acme.FirstServiceImpl""/>
<bean id=""firstService""  
    class=""org.springframework.transaction.interceptor.TransactionProxyFactoryBean"">
    <property name=""transactionManager"" ref=""firstJpaTm""/>
    <property name=""target"" ref=""firstRealService""/>
    <property name=""transactionAttributes"">
        <props>
           <prop key=""insert*"">PROPAGATION_REQUIRED</prop>
           <prop key=""update*"">PROPAGATION_REQUIRED</prop>
           <prop key=""*"">PROPAGATION_REQUIRED,readOnly</prop>
        </props>
    </property>
</bean>
<!-- similar for your second service -->


If you are require a transaction spanning both databases, then you will need to use a JTA transaction manager. The API states:


  This transaction manager is appropriate for applications that use a single JPA EntityManagerFactory for transactional data access. JTA (usually through JtaTransactionManager) is necessary for accessing multiple transactional resources within the same transaction. Note that you need to configure your JPA provider accordingly in order to make it participate in JTA transactions.


What this means is that you will need to provide a JTA transaction manager. In our application, we use config similar to the following:

<tx:annotation-driven transaction-manager=""txManager""/>

<bean id=""txManager"" 
    class=""org.springframework.transaction.jta.JtaTransactionManager"">
    <property name=""transactionManagerName"" value=""appserver/jndi/path"" />
</bean>


If you are deploying within an appserver, then the spring JtaTransactionManager needs to do a lookup to the real XA-compliant JTA transaction manager provided by the appserver. However, you can also use a standalone JTA transaction manager (but I haven't tried this myself yet)

As for configuring the Jpa persistence provider, I'm not that familiar. What JPA persistence provider are you using?

The code above is based on our approach, where we were using native Hibernate as opposed to Hibernate's JPA implementation. In this case, we were able to get rid of the two HibernateTransactionManager beans, and simply ensure that both SessionFactories were injected with the same JTA TM, and then use the tx:annotation-driven element.

Hope this helps

Don't use it, as it has been deprecated since ECMAScript v3.

encodeURI()

Use encodeURI when you want a working URL. Make this call:

encodeURI(""http://www.google.com/a file with spaces.html"")


to get:


http://www.google.com/a%20file%20with%20spaces.html


Don't call encodeURIComponent since it would destroy the URL and return

encodeURIComponent()

Use encodeURIComponent when you want to encode a URL parameter.

param1 = encodeURIComponent(""http://xyz.com/?a=12&b=55"")


Then you may create the URL you need:

url = ""http://domain.com/?param1="" + param1 + ""&param2=99"";


And you will get this complete URL:

http://www.domain.com/?param1=http%3A%2F%2Fxyz.com%2F%Ffa%3D12%26b%3D55&param2=99

Note that encodeURIComponent does not escape the ' character. A common bug is to use it to create html attributes such as href='MyUrl', which could suffer an injection bug. If you are constructing html from strings, either use "" instead of ' for attribute quotes, or add an extra layer of encoding (' can be encoded as %27).

As a fundamental principle, we do not want to be responsible for the loss of sensitive data. The users are perfectly good at that, themselves.

Developers don't **need** access to production data. It's simply laziness. Define and create test data to exercise defined test cases (including edge cases) and don't rely on the random-esque nature of production data.

Data files placed in the ""Common Application Data"" folder will be copied to ""\ProgramData\Manufacturer\ProductName"" (on Vista) or ""\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Manufacturer\ProductName"" (on XP) when the installer is run.

<target name=""config"">
    <property name=""configFile"" value=""${environment}.config.xml"" />
    <if test=""${file::exists(configFile)}"">
        <echo message=""Loading ${configFile}..."" />
        <include buildfile=""${configFile}"" />
    </if>
    <if test=""${not file::exists(configFile) and environment != 'local'}"">
        <fail message=""Configuration file '${configFile}' could not be found."" />
    </if>
</target>


Note, I like to allow team members to define their own local.config.xml files that don't get committed to source control.  This provides a nice place to store local connection strings or other local environment settings.

Step 4: Set the environment property when you invoke NAnt, e.g.:


nant -D:environment=dev
nant -D:environment=test
nant -D:environment=production

4795,94869,14382.0,2008-09-18T17:46:36Z,78450,2,"Well, it looks as if I will be answering my own question.

First, the documentation flat out lies where it reads ""In any style command the first row index may be set to one of the special strings 'splitlast' or 'splitfirst' to indicate that the style should be used only for the last row of a split table, or the first row of a continuation.""  In the current release, the ""splitlast"" and ""splitfirst"" row indices break with the aforementioned TypeErrors on the TEXTCOLOR and BACKGROUND commnds.

My suspicion, based on reading the source code, is that only the tablestyle line commands (GRID, BOX, LINEABOVE, and LINEBELOW) are currently compatible with the 'splitfirst' and 'splitlast' row indices.  I suspect that all cell commands break with the aforementioned TypeErrors.

However, I was able to do what I wanted by subclassing the Table class and overriding the onSplit method.  Here is my code:

class XTable(Table):
    def onSplit(self, T, byRow=1):
        T.setStyle(TableStyle([
          ('TEXTCOLOR', (0, 1), (1, 1), colors.black)]))


What this does is apply the text color black to the first and second cell of the second row of each page.  (The first row is a header, repeated by the repeatRows parameter of the Table.)  More precisely, it is doing this to the first and second cell of each frame, but since I am using the SimpleDocTemplate, frames and pages are identical.

4102,80425,11521.0,2008-09-17T06:02:38Z,79850,18,"Designing a bigtable schema is an open process, and basically requires you to think about:


The access patterns you will be using and how often each will be used
The relationships between your types
What indices you are going to need
The write patterns you will be using (in order to effectively spread load)


GAE's datastore automatically denormalizes your data. That is, each index contains a (mostly) complete copy of the data, and thus every index adds significantly to time taken to perform a write, and the storage space used.

If this were not the case, designing a Datastore schema would be a lot more work: You would have to think carefully about the primary key for each type, and consider the effect of your decision on the locality of data. For example, when rendering a blog post you would probably need to display the comments to go along with it, so each comment's key would probably begin with the associated post's key.

With Datastore, this is not such a big deal: The query you use will look something like ""Select * FROM Comment WHERE post_id = N."" (If you want to page the comments, you would also have a limit clause, and a possible suffix of "" AND comment_id > last_comment_id"".) Once you add such a query, Datastore will build the index for you, and your reads will be magically fast.

Something to keep in mind is that each additional index creates some additional cost: it is best if you can use as few access patterns as possible, since it will reduce the number of indices GAE will construct, and thus the total storage required by your data.

Reading over this answer, I find it a little vague. Maybe a hands-on design question would help to scope this down? :-)

No matter how DRY and OO and easy your framework makes things ( which is in this case - alot =) you've still got  to remember it's running in front of a bog-standard relational database, which has atomic commits as one of it's defining features. It's designed from the ground up to make sure either all of your changes are commited, or none.

You're effectively going to be over riding this standard functionality with something that goes 100% against the grain of how rails +  was designed to work. This is likely to lead (as said already) to inconsistent data.

substr($string, 0, strpos(wordwrap($string, $your_desired_width), ""\n""));


One thing this oneliner doesn't handle is the case when the text itself is shorter than the desired width. To handle this edge-case, one should do something like:

if (strlen($string) > $your_desired_width) 
{
    $string = wordwrap($string, $your_desired_width);
    $string = substr($string, 0, strpos($string, ""\n""));

The above solution has the problem of prematurely cutting the text if it contains a newline before the actual cutpoint. Here a version which solves this problem:

function tokenTruncate($string, $your_desired_width) {
  $parts = preg_split('/([\s\n\r]+)/', $string, null, PREG_SPLIT_DELIM_CAPTURE);
  $parts_count = count($parts);

  $length = 0;

    $length += strlen($parts[$last_part]);
    if ($length > $your_desired_width) { break; }
  }

  return implode(array_slice($parts, 0, $last_part));
}


Also, here is the PHPUnit testclass used to test the implementation:

class TokenTruncateTest extends PHPUnit_Framework_TestCase {
  public function testBasic() {
    $this->assertEquals(""1 3 5 7 9 "",
      tokenTruncate(""1 3 5 7 9 11 14"", 10));

Build Agents. It's very simple to turn any box into a build machine and run a build on it. MSFT got this one right.
Reporting. All relevant build results (test included) are stored in a SQL database and reported on via SQL Server Reporting Services. This is an immensely powerful tool for charting build and test results over time. CC Net doesn't have this built in.

  In IE7 (and probably all famous browsers, including old Firefox 2), if we submit a file like '//server1/path/to/file/filename' it works properly and gives the full path to the file and the filename.
  
  I have no clue how to overcome this 'new feature' because it causes all upload forms in my webapp to stop working on Firefox 3.


There's a major misunderstanding here. Why do you ever need the full file path on the server side? Imagine that I am the client and I have a file at C:\path\to\passwords.txt and I give the full file path to you. How would you as being a server ever get its contents? Do you have an open TCP connection to my local disk file system? Did you test the file upload functionality when you've brought your webapp into production on a different server machine?

It will only work when both the client and server runs at physically the same machine, because you will then have the access to the same hard disk file system. This would only occur when you're locally developing your website and thus both the webbrowser (client) and webserver (server) by coincidence runs at the same machine.

That the full file path is being sent in MSIE and other ancient webbrowsers is due to a security bug. The W3 and RFC2388 specifications have never mentioned to include the full file path. Only the file name. Firefox is doing its job correctly.

To handle uploaded files, you should not need to know the full file path. You should rather be interested in the full file contents which the client has already sent to the server in the request body in case of a multipart/form-data request. Change your form to look like the following as stated in RFC2388:

<form action=""upload-script-url"" method=""post"" enctype=""multipart/form-data"">
    <input type=""file"" name=""file"">
    <input type=""submit"">
</form>


How to obtain the contents of the uploaded file in the server side depends on the server side programming language you're using.


Java/JSP: you'd like to use HttpServletRequest#getPart() or Apache Commons FileUpload API to parse it. You should end up with an InputStream with the file contents which you in turn can write to any OutputStream to your taste. You can find an example in this answer.
Java/JSF: you'd like to use <h:inputFile> component or any other file upload component provided by the component library you're using. Also here, you'd like to obtain the file contents in flavor of an InputStream. See this answer for an example.
PHP: the file contents is already implicitly stored on the temp disk. You'd like to use move_uploaded_file() function to move it to the desired location. See also PHP manual.
ASP.NET: no detailed answer from me since I don't do it, but Google has found some examples for me: ASP.NET example, ASP.NET 2.0 example


Whenever you want to obtain the file name part of the uploaded file, you should trim the full path off from the file name. This information is namely completely irrelevant to you. Also see for example this Apache Commons FileUpload FAQ entry


  Why does FileItem.getName() return the whole path, and not just the file name?
  
  Internet Explorer provides the entire path to the uploaded file and not just the base file name. Since FileUpload provides exactly what was supplied by the client (browser), you may want to remove this path information in your application.

In Rails, you essentially start by defining your tables (with field names and their specifics). Then ActiveRecord will map them to Ruby classes or models.
In Grails, it's the reverse: you start by defining your models (Groovy classes) and when you hit run, GORM (Grails ActiveRecord equivalent) will create the related database and tables (or update them). Which may also be why you don't have the concept of 'migrations' in Grails (although I think it will come in some future release).
I don't know if one is better than the other. I guess it depends on your context.

This being said, I'm still myself wondering which one to choose. As Tom was saying, if you're dependent on Java you can still go for JRuby - so Java reuse shouldn't be your sole criterion.

1081021,20170989,576911.0,2013-11-24T04:14:32Z,81870,185,"C++11 update to a very old question: Print variable type in C++.

The accepted (and good) answer is to use typeid(a).name(), where a is a variable name.

Now in C++11 we have decltype(x), which can turn an expression into a type.  And decltype() comes with its own set of very interesting rules.  For example decltype(a) and decltype((a)) will generally be different types (and for good and understandable reasons once those reasons are exposed).

Will our trusty typeid(a).name() help us explore this brave new world?

No.

But the tool that will is not that complicated.  And it is that tool which I am using as an answer to this question.  I will compare and contrast this new tool to typeid(a).name().  And this new tool is actually built on top of typeid(a).name().

The fundamental issue:

typeid(a).name()


throws away cv-qualifiers, references, and lvalue/rvalue-ness.  For example:

const int ci = 0;
std::cout << typeid(ci).name() << '\n';


For me outputs:

i


and I'm guessing on MSVC outputs:

int


I.e. the const is gone.  This is not a QOI (Quality Of Implementation) issue.  The standard mandates this behavior.

What I'm recommending below is:

template <typename T> std::string type_name();


which would be used like this:

const int ci = 0;
std::cout << type_name<decltype(ci)>() << '\n';


and for me outputs:

int const


<disclaimer> I have not tested this on MSVC. </disclaimer>  But I welcome feedback from those who do.

The C++11 Solution

I am using __cxa_demangle for non-MSVC platforms as recommend by ipapadop in his answer to demangle types.  But on MSVC I'm trusting typeid to demangle names (untested).  And this core is wrapped around some simple testing that detects, restores and reports cv-qualifiers and references to the input type.

#include <type_traits>
#include <typeinfo>
#ifndef _MSC_VER
#   include <cxxabi.h>
#endif
#include <memory>
#include <string>
#include <cstdlib>

template <class T>
std::string
type_name()
{
    typedef typename std::remove_reference<T>::type TR;
    std::unique_ptr<char, void(*)(void*)> own
           (
#ifndef _MSC_VER
                abi::__cxa_demangle(typeid(TR).name(), nullptr,
                                           nullptr, nullptr),
#else
                nullptr,
#endif
                std::free
           );
    std::string r = own != nullptr ? own.get() : typeid(TR).name();
    if (std::is_const<TR>::value)
        r += "" const"";
    if (std::is_volatile<TR>::value)
        r += "" volatile"";
    if (std::is_lvalue_reference<T>::value)
        r += ""&"";
    else if (std::is_rvalue_reference<T>::value)
        r += ""&&"";
    return r;
}


The Results

With this solution I can do this:

int& foo_lref();
int&& foo_rref();
int foo_value();

int
main()
{
    int i = 0;
    const int ci = 0;
    std::cout << ""decltype(i) is "" << type_name<decltype(i)>() << '\n';
    std::cout << ""decltype((i)) is "" << type_name<decltype((i))>() << '\n';
    std::cout << ""decltype(ci) is "" << type_name<decltype(ci)>() << '\n';
    std::cout << ""decltype((ci)) is "" << type_name<decltype((ci))>() << '\n';
    std::cout << ""decltype(static_cast<int&>(i)) is "" << type_name<decltype(static_cast<int&>(i))>() << '\n';
    std::cout << ""decltype(static_cast<int&&>(i)) is "" << type_name<decltype(static_cast<int&&>(i))>() << '\n';
    std::cout << ""decltype(static_cast<int>(i)) is "" << type_name<decltype(static_cast<int>(i))>() << '\n';
    std::cout << ""decltype(foo_lref()) is "" << type_name<decltype(foo_lref())>() << '\n';
    std::cout << ""decltype(foo_rref()) is "" << type_name<decltype(foo_rref())>() << '\n';
    std::cout << ""decltype(foo_value()) is "" << type_name<decltype(foo_value())>() << '\n';
}


and the output is:

decltype(i) is int
decltype((i)) is int&
decltype(ci) is int const
decltype((ci)) is int const&
decltype(static_cast<int&>(i)) is int&
decltype(static_cast<int&&>(i)) is int&&
decltype(static_cast<int>(i)) is int
decltype(foo_lref()) is int&
decltype(foo_rref()) is int&&
decltype(foo_value()) is int


Note (for example) the difference between decltype(i) and decltype((i)).  The former is the type of the declaration of i.  The latter is the ""type"" of the expression i. (expressions never have reference type, but as a convention decltype represents lvalue expressions with lvalue references).

Thus this tool is an excellent vehicle just to learn about decltype, in addition to exploring and debugging your own code.

In contrast, if I were to build this just on typeid(a).name(), without adding back lost cv-qualifiers or references, the output would be:

decltype(i) is int
decltype((i)) is int
decltype(ci) is int
decltype((ci)) is int
decltype(static_cast<int&>(i)) is int
decltype(static_cast<int&&>(i)) is int
decltype(static_cast<int>(i)) is int
decltype(foo_lref()) is int
decltype(foo_rref()) is int
decltype(foo_value()) is int


I.e. Every reference and cv-qualifier is stripped off.

C++14 Update

Just when you think you've got a solution to a problem nailed, someone always comes out of nowhere and shows you a much better way. :-)

This answer from Jamboree shows how to get the type name in C++14 at compile time.  It is a brilliant solution for a couple reasons:


It's at compile time!
You get the compiler itself to do the job instead of a library (even a std::lib).  This means more accurate results for the latest language features (like lambdas).


Jamboree's answer doesn't quite lay everything out for VS, and I'm tweaking his code a little bit.  But since this answer gets a lot of views, take some time to go over there and upvote his answer, without which, this update would never have happened.

Anyway, you can do a lot more than just combine things. If you wanted to be smart about it,  you could set up per-subfeed and whole-feed filters to give granular or over-arching filtering abilities as the news changes and you get bored with one topic or another.

Today, Microsoft is fading out support for PostScript fonts. Try using one as an UI font in Vista. Good luck ;-)

The claim in this ThinkVitamin article that Opera and Safari/Webkit browsers don't cache URLs with ?query=strings is false.

Adding a version number parameter to a URL is a perfectly acceptable way to do cache-busting.

What may have confused the author of the ThinkVitamin article is the fact that hitting Enter in the address/location bar in Safari and Opera results in different behavior for URLs with query string in them.

However, (and this is the important part!) Opera and Safari behave just like IE and Firefox when it comes to caching embedded/linked images and stylesheets and scripts in web pages - regardless of whether they have ""?"" characters in their URLs.

Ben's answer is reasonable, except he seems to have a 'not' where he doesn't want one. Dropping the table only if it doesn't exist isn't quite right.

You will indeed need multiple statements. Either conditionally create then populate:


CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE IF NOT EXISTS fubar ( id int, name varchar(80) )
TRUNCATE TABLE fubar
INSERT INTO fubar SELECT * FROM barfu


or just drop and recreate


DROP TABLE IF EXISTS fubar
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE fubar SELECT id, name FROM barfu


With pure SQL those are your two real classes of solutions. I like the second better.

(With a stored procedure you could reduce it to a single statement. Something like: TruncateAndPopulate(fubar) But by the time you write the code for TruncateAndPopulate() you'll spend more time than just using the SQL above.)

4307,84943,16219.0,2008-09-17T16:17:05Z,84340,78,"A lot of times some quick task comes up that isn't part of the main software you are developing.  Sometimes the task is one off ie compare this file to the database and let me know the differences.  It is a lot easier to do text parsing in Perl/Ruby/Python than it is in Java or C# (partially because it is a lot easier to use regular expressions).  It will probably take a lot less time to parse the text file using Perl/Ruby/Python (or maybe even vbscript cringe and then load it into the database than it would to create a Java/C# program to do it or to do it by hand.

Also, due to the ease at which most of the dynamic languages parse text, they are great for code generation.  Sure your final project must be in C#/Java/Transact SQL but instead of cutting and pasting 100 times, finding errors, and cutting and pasting another 100 times it is often (but not always) easier just to use a code generator.

A recent example at work is we needed to get data from one accounting system into our accounting system.  The system has an import format, but the old system had a completely different format (fixed width although some things had to be matched).  The task is not to create a program to migrate the data over and over again.  It is to shove the data into our system and then maintain it there going forward.  So even though we are a C# and SQL Server shop, I used Python to convert the data into the format that could be imported by our application.  Ultimately it doesn't matter that I used python, it matters that the data is in the system.  My boss was pretty impressed.

Where I often see the dynamic languages used for is testing.  It is much easier to create a Python/Perl/Ruby program to link to a web service and throw some data against it than it is to create the equivalent Java program.  You can also use python to hit against command line programs, generate a ton of garbage (but still valid) test data, etc.. quite easily.

The other thing that dynamic languages are big on is code generation.  Creating the C#/C++/Java code.  Some examples follow:

The first code generation task I often see is people using dynamic languages to maintain constants in the system.  Instead of hand coding a bunch of enums, a dynamic language can be used to fairly easily parse a text file and create the Java/C# code with the enums.

SQL is a whole other ball game but often you get better performance by cut and pasting 100 times instead of trying to do a function (due to caching of execution plans or putting complicated logic in a function causing you to go row by row instead of in a set).  In fact it is quite useful to use the table definition to create certain stored procedures automatically.

It is always better to get buy in for a code generator.  But even if you don't, is it more fun to spend time cutting/pasting or is it more fun to create a Perl/Python/Ruby script once and then have that generate the code?  If it takes you hours to hand code something but less time to create a code generator, then even if you use it once you have saved time and hence money.  If it takes you longer to create a code generator than it takes to hand code once but you know you will have to update the code more than once, it may still make sense.  If it takes you 2 hours to hand code, 4 hours to do the generator but you know you'll have to hand code equivalent work another 5 or 6 times than it is obviously better to create the generator.

Also some things are easier with dynamic languages than Java/C#/C/C++.  In particular regular expressions come to mind.  If you start using regular expressions in Perl and realize their value, you may suddenly start making use of the Java regular expression library if you haven't before.  If you have then there may be something else.

I will leave you with one last example of a task that would have been great for a dynamic language.  My work mate had to take a directory full of files and burn them to various cd's for various customers.  There were a few customers but a lot of files and you had to look in them to see what they were.  He did this task by hand....A Java/C# program would have saved time, but for one time and with all the development overhead it isn't worth it.  However slapping something together in Perl/Python/Ruby probably would have been worth it.  He spent several hours doing it.  It would have taken less than one to create the Python script to inspect each file, match which customer it goes to, and then move the file to the appropriate place.....Again, not part of the standard job.  But the task came up as a one off.  Is it better to do it yourself, spend the larger amount of time to make Java/C# do the task, or spend a much smaller amount of time doing it in Python/Perl/Ruby.  If you are using C or C++ the point is even more dramatic due to the extra concerns of programming in C or C++ (pointers, no array bounds checking, etc.).

You'll notice that there are a few bits in there that you might not need.

For example, my app needed to retain the successfully-logged-in LDAP context for further use by the user once logged in -- the app's purpose is to let users log in via their AD credentials and then perform further AD-related functions.  So because of that, I have a custom authentication token, LdapAuthenticationToken, that I pass around (rather than Spring's default Authentication token) which allows me to attach the LDAP context.  In LdapAuthenticationProvider.authenticate(), I create that token and pass it back out; in LdapAuthenticatorImpl.authenticate(), I attach the logged-in context to the return object so that it can be added to the user's Spring authentication object.

Also, in LdapAuthenticationProvider.authenticate(), I assign all logged-in users the ROLE_USER role -- that's what lets me then test for that role in my intercept-url elements.  You'll want to make this match whatever role you want to test for, or even assign roles based on Active Directory groups or whatever.

Finally, and a corollary to that, the way I implemented LdapAuthenticationProvider.authenticate() gives all users with valid AD accounts the same ROLE_USER role.  Obviously, in that method, you can perform further tests on the user (i.e., is the user in a specific AD group?) and assign roles that way, or even test for some condition before even granting the user access at all.

Bottom-up is called Hierarchical agglomerative clustering. Here's a simple, well-documented algorithm: http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/hierarchical-agglomerative-clustering-1.html.

Distributing a bottom-up algorithm is tricky because each distributed process needs the entire dataset to make choices about appropriate clusters. It also needs a list of clusters at its current level so it doesn't add a data point to more than one cluster at the same level.

Top-down hierarchy construction is called Divisive clustering. K-means is one option to decide how to split your hierarchy's nodes. This paper looks at K-means and Principal Direction Divisive Partitioning (PDDP) for node splitting: http://scgroup.hpclab.ceid.upatras.gr/faculty/stratis/Papers/tm07book.pdf. In the end, you just need to split each parent node into relatively well-balanced child nodes.

A top-down approach is easier to distribute. After your first node split, each node created can be shipped to a distributed process to be split again and so on... Each distributed process needs only to be aware of the subset of the dataset it is splitting. Only the parent process is aware of the full dataset.

In addition, each split could be performed in parallel. Two examples for k-means:

Most windows services have been moved to run in Session 0 now in order to properly isolate them from the rest of the system. An extension of this is that the first user to login to the system no longer is placed in Session #0, they are placed in Session 1. And hence, the isolation will break code that does certain types of communication between services and desktop applications.

The best way to write code today that will work on Vista and Server 2008 going forward when doing communication between services and applications is to use a proper cross-process API like RPC, Named Pipes, etc. Do not use SendMessage/PostMessage as that will fail under Session 0 Isolation.

Note that if you need to use i.remove(); in your loop, or access the actual iterator in some way, you cannot use the for( : ) idiom, since the actual Iterator is merely inferred.

As was noted by Denis Bueno, this code works for any object that implements the Iterable interface.

Also, if the right-hand side of the for(:) idiom is an array rather than an Iterable object, the internal code uses an int index counter and checks against array.length instead. See the Java Language Specification.

For your ""globalized"" URIs, a regular MVC route, with a constraint that the ""locale"" parameter must be equal to ""en"", ""de"", etc., will do. The constraint will prevent non-globalized URIs from matching the route.

For a ""non-globalized"" URI, make a ""catch-all"" route which simply redirects to the default or cookie-set locale URI.

Place the ""globalized"" route above the ""catch-all"" route in Global.asax, so that ""already-globalized"" URIs don't fall through to the redirection.

i sense there is something horribly wrong with this code. The GetHashCode method does not guarantee, that the returned hash values should be in any way unique given two different objects. As far as GetHashCode is concerned, it can return 0 for all objects and still be considered correct.

When two object are the same (the Equals method returns true), they MUST have the same value returned from GetHashCode. When two objects have the same hash value, they can be the same object (Equals returns true) or be different objects (Equals returns false).

There are no other guarantees on the result of GetHashCode.

The default implementation of GetHashCode in Object class return a hash value based on objects address in memory or something similar. If some other identity comparison is required, you have to override both Equals and GetHashCode.

You can then distinguish by name and position within the tree structure (E.g. DepartmentRoot, DepartmentNode, DepartmentLeaf) if need be..

Update Following Comment from OP

Looking at your question, you said that ""some"" are special, and in your diagram, you have different nodes looking differently at different levels. The nodes may be different in their design, you can build a tree structure many ways. For example, a single abstract class that can have child nodes, if no children, its a leaf, if no parent, its a root but this can change in its lifetime. Or, a fixed class structure in which leafs are a specific class type that cannot have children added to them in any way.

IF your design does not need you to distinguish nodes differently depending on their position (relative to the root) it suggests that you have an abstract class used for them all.

In which case, it raises the question, how is it different? 

If it is simply the same as the standard node everywhere else, but with a bit of styling, how about StyledNode? Do you even need it to be seperate (no style == no big deal, it doesn't render).

Since I don't know the mechanics of how the tree is architected, there could possibly be several factors to consider when naming.

The simplest Theme includes only a style.css file, plus images, if any. To create such a Theme, you must specify a set of templates to inherit for use with the Theme by editing the Template: line in the style.css header comments. For example, if you wanted the Theme ""Rose"" to inherit the templates from another Theme called ""test"", you would include Template: test in the comments at the beginning of Rose's style.css. Now ""test"" is the parent Theme for ""Rose"", which still consists only of a style.css file and the concomitant images, all located in the directory wp-content/themes/Rose. (Note that specifying a parent Theme will inherit all of the template files from that Theme â meaning that any template files in the child Theme's directory will be ignored.)

The comment header lines in style.css are required for WordPress to be able to identify a Theme and display it in the Administration Panel under Design > Themes as an available Theme option along with any other installed Themes. 

The Theme Name, Version, Author, and Author URI fields are parsed by WordPress and used to display that data in the Current Theme area on the top line of the current theme information, where the Author's Name is hyperlinked to the Author URI.  The Description and Tag fields are parsed and displayed in the body of the theme's information, and if the theme has a parent theme, that information is placed in the information body as well.  In the Available Themes section, only the Theme Name, Description, and Tags fields are used.

None of these fields have any restrictions - all are parsed as strings.  In addition, none of them are required in code, though in practice the fields not marked as optional in the list above are all used to provide contextual information to the WordPress administrator and should be included for all themes.

You can embed SVG files with <object>/<embed> and in cutting-edge browsers (Opera, Safari) also <img> and CSS background-image.

You can put SVG in data: URI to avoid using external files.

Simple mathematical expressions can be written with help of Unicode and basic HTML/CSS (Opera 9.5 supports large chunk of MathML via CSS). For anything more complex you'll need to use images, like Wikipedia does.

HTML misinterprets namespace prefixes, so you won't be able to (properly) use other XML markup with HTML DOM. HTML5 has data-* attributes for application-specific markup additions. For metadata consider Microformats.

However if you want to embed XML only for non-browsers (robots), then you could use HTML-compatible XHTML subset and HTTP content negotiation to send proper XML with proper type to clients that understand it (if you thoroughly test page in both XML and HTML modes, then it won't be harmful).

There are primarily two sections of the ELF binary as emitted by gcc which are of interest for exception handling. They are .eh_frame and .gcc_except_table. 

.eh_frame follows the DWARF format (the debugging format that primarily comes into play when you're using gdb). It has exactly the same format as the .debug_frame section emitted when compiling with -g. Essentially, it contains the information necessary to pop back to the state of the machine registers and the stack at any point higher up the call stack. See the Dwarf Standard at dwarfstd.org for more information on this.

.gcc_except_table contains information about the exception handling ""landing pads"" the locations of handlers. This is necessary so as to know when to stop unwinding. Unfortunately this section is not well documented. The only snippets of information I have been able to glean come from the gcc mailing list. See particularly this post

The remaining piece of information is then what actual code interprets the information found in these data sections. The relevant code lives in libstdc++ and libgcc. I cannot remember at the moment which pieces live in which. The interpreter for the DWARF call frame information can be found in the gcc source code in the file gcc/unwind-dw.c

  /B         Matches pattern if at the beginning of a line.
  /E         Matches pattern if at the end of a line.
  /L         Uses search strings literally.
  /R         Uses search strings as regular expressions.
  /S         Searches for matching files in the current directory and all
             subdirectories.
  /I         Specifies that the search is not to be case-sensitive.
  /X         Prints lines that match exactly.
  /V         Prints only lines that do not contain a match.
  /N         Prints the line number before each line that matches.
  /M         Prints only the filename if a file contains a match.
  /O         Prints character offset before each matching line.
  /P         Skip files with non-printable characters.
  /OFF[LINE] Do not skip files with offline attribute set.
  /A:attr    Specifies color attribute with two hex digits. See ""color /?""
  /F:file    Reads file list from the specified file(/ stands for console).
  /C:string  Uses specified string as a literal search string.
  /G:file    Gets search strings from the specified file(/ stands for console).
  /D:dir     Search a semicolon delimited list of directories
  strings    Text to be searched for.
  [drive:][path]filename
             Specifies a file or files to search.

Use spaces to separate multiple search strings unless the argument is prefixed
with /C.  For example, 'FINDSTR ""hello there"" x.y' searches for ""hello"" or
""there"" in file x.y.  'FINDSTR /C:""hello there"" x.y' searches for
""hello there"" in file x.y.

Regular expression quick reference:
  .        Wildcard: any character
  *        Repeat: zero or more occurances of previous character or class
  ^        Line position: beginning of line
  $        Line position: end of line
  [class]  Character class: any one character in set
  [^class] Inverse class: any one character not in set
  [x-y]    Range: any characters within the specified range
  \x       Escape: literal use of metacharacter x
  \<xyz    Word position: beginning of word

In truth, the same concept should apply here as it does in the web app answer listed above.

All of your data objects should be hard-coded, and it's just the connection string (which you'll have to either ask the user for, or push out as update when the DB moves) which will get modified.

For example, create a App.Config file in your project. Have one of your configuration values  be the connection string. This config value will be where you go to get the connection string whenever you need it. Then your wizard will be there to allow users to easily modify the connection.

If you need to query the DB (and it sounds like you probably do) for results then I agree with Kris K, except I would endeavor to rebuild the DB after every test case, not just every suite.

This helps avoid dangerous interacting tests

As for tools, I would recommend CppUnit. You aren't really doing unit tests, but it shouldn't matter as the xUnit framework should give you the set up and teardown framework you'll need to automatically set up your test fixture

Obviously this can result in slow-running tests, depending on your database size, population etc. You may be able to attach/detach databases rather than dropping/rebuilding.

If you're interested in further research, check out XUnit Test Patterns. It's a fine book and a good website for this kind of thing.

So that when you did ""DROP DATABASE"", instead of going ""Oh, hes droppping the database, we should back up now just in case"" it merely wrote a ""DROP DATABASE"" to the last binlog.

What you need to do is recover the database from a last-known-good, and apply the binlogs that happened between that recover point and the DROP command.

You can slightly speed it up with the usual N! → N22N dynamic programming trick (compute hp[v][w][S] = ""is there a path that has endpoints v and w and whose vertices are the subset S"" for every subset S and every two vertices v and w in it using DP), but that's still exponential.

However, there are many special kinds of graphs for which Hamiltonian paths will always exist, and they can be found easily (see work of Posa, Dirac, Ore, etc.)

For instance, the following is true: If every vertex of the graph has degree at least n/2, then the graph has a Hamiltonian path. You can in fact find one in O(n2), or IIRC even O(n log n) if you do it more cleverly.
[Rough sketch: First, just connect all vertices in some ""Hamiltonian"" cycle, nevermind if the edges are actually in the graph. Now for every edge (v,w) of your cycle that is not actually in the graph, consider the rest of the cycle: v...w. As deg(v)+deg(w)>=n, there exist consecutive x,y in your list (in that order) such that w is a neighbour of x and v is a neighbour of y. [Proof: Consider {the set of all neighbours of w} and {the set of all successors in your list of neighbours of v}; they must intersect.] Now change your cycle [v...xy...wv] to [vy...wx...v] instead, it has at least one less invalid edge, so you'll need at most n iterations to get a true Hamiltonian cycle. More details here.]

BTW: if what you are looking for is just a walk that includes every edge once, it's called an Eulerian walk and for graphs that have it (number of vertices of odd degree is 0 or 2), one can quite easily be found in polynomial time (fast).

Redesign the application so that you don't have two different processes (both with database connections) writing to the database and roll it into a single app.
Create application C that handles all the database transactions for A and B.
Roll your own two phase commit. Application C acts as the coordinator. C signals A and B to ask if they're ready to commit. A and B do their processing, and respond to C with either a ""ready"" or a ""fail"" reply (note that there should be a timeout on C to avoid an infinite wait if one process hangs or dies). If both reply ready then C tells them to commit. Otherwise it sends a rollback signal.


Note that you may run into issues with option 3 if app A is relying on foreign keys from app B (which you didn't state, so this may not be an issue). Oracle's read consistency would probably prevent this from being allowed, since app A's transaction will begin before app B. Just a warning.

ignoring pronouns is done via a stoplist.
preserving proper nouns? You mean, detecting named entities, like Hoover Dam and saying ""it's one word"" or compound nouns, like programming language? I'll give you a hint: that's tough one, but there exist libraries for both. Look for NER (Named entitiy recognition) and lexical chunking. OpenNLP is a Java-Toolkit that does both.
ignoring hyphenation? You mean, like at line breaks? Use regular expressions and verify the resulting word via dictionary lookup.
handling plurals/stemming: you can look into the Snowball stemmer. It does the trick nicely.
""grouping"" adjectives with their nouns is generally a task of shallow parsing. But if you are looking specifically for qualitative adjectives (good, bad, shitty, amazing...) you may be interested in sentiment analysis. LingPipe does this, and a lot more.


I'm sorry, I know you said you wanted to KISS, but unfortunately, your demands aren't that easy to meet. Nevertheless, there exist tools for all of this, and you should be able to just tie them together and not have to perform any task yourself, if you don't want to. If you want to perform a task yourself, I suggest you look at stemming, it's the easiest of all.

If you go with Java, combine Lucene with the OpenNLP toolkit. You will get very good results, as Lucene already has a stemmer built in and a lot of tutorial. The OpenNLP toolkit on the other hand is poorly documented, but you won't need too much out of it. You might also be interested in NLTK, written in Python.

I would say you drop your last requirement, as it involves shallow parsing and will definetly not impove your results.

Ah, btw. the exact term of that document-term-frequency-thing you were looking for is called tf-idf. It's pretty much the best way to look for document frequency for terms. In order to do it properly, you won't get around using multidimenional vector matrices.

Symptom: When using RANK in the ORDER BY clause of a SharePoint Search query only the first ORDER BY column is used in the results. 

Cause: RANK is a special property that is ranked in the full text index and hence cannot be used with other managed properties. 

Resolution: Do not use multiple properties in conjunction with the RANK property.

Implementing multi-tenanting in this manner allows you to effectively write a single tenant application and only worry about the multi-tenanting at the point where you create / retrieve the session.

I haven't delved deep into the details as yet (I need to do something similar in a few months), but I think the easiest way to manage which database a session is connected to is via a custom ISessionFactory implementation that can determine which connection to use (based on an external aspect such as the host portion of the request url).

I have seen at least one post around the net somewhere discussing this, but I cannot find the link at this time.

If you are using Castle Windsor, have a look at the NHibernate integration facility.  This supports the concept of multiple ( named ) session factories which would allow you to have a session factory per client.  The integration facility provides an ISessionManager interface which allows you to open a session on a named session factory ( as well as providing per request session semantics for web applications ).  Anything requiring access to the session could simply take an ISession constructor parameter and you could create a factory that takes an ISessionManager as a constructor parameter.  You factory could then open a session on the appropriate named session factory by inspecting the request to determine which named session factory should be used.

Say you have a ResourceDictionary called MyResourceDictionary. In your MyResourceDictionary.xaml file, put the x:Class attribute in the root element, like so:

<ResourceDictionary xmlns=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation""
                    xmlns:x=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml""

                    x:ClassModifier=""public"">


Then, create a code behind file called MyResourceDictionary.xaml.cs with the following declaration:

namespace MyCompany.MyProject
{
    partial class MyResourceDictionary : ResourceDictionary
    { 
       public MyResourceDictionary()
       {
          InitializeComponent();
       }     
       ... // event handlers ahead..

}


And you're done. You can put whatever you wish in the code behind: methods, properties and event handlers.

4725,92959,13179.0,2008-09-18T14:19:13Z,92860,5,"You would want to create an event on the control that is subscribed to in the parent. See OdeToCode for an example.

Here is the article for longevity sake:

Some user controls are entirely self contained, for example, a user control displaying current stock quotes does not need to interact with any other content on the page. Other user controls will contain buttons to post back. Although it is possible to subscribe to the button click event from the containing page, doing so would break some of the object oriented rules of encapsulation. A better idea is to publish an event in the user control to allow any interested parties to handle the event.

This technique is commonly referred to as âevent bubblingâ since the event can continue to pass through layers, starting at the bottom (the user control) and perhaps reaching the top level (the page) like a bubble moving up a champagne glass.

For starters, letâs create a user control with a button attached.

<%@ Control Language=""c#"" AutoEventWireup=""false"" 
    Codebehind=""WebUserControl1.ascx.cs"" 
    Inherits=""aspnet.eventbubble.WebUserControl1"" 
    TargetSchema=""http://schemas.microsoft.com/intellisense/ie5""
%>
<asp:Panel id=""Panel1"" runat=""server"" Width=""128px"" Height=""96px"">
    WebUserControl1 
    <asp:Button id=""Button1"" Text=""Button"" runat=""server""/>
</asp:Panel>


The code behind for the user control looks like the following.

public class WebUserControl1 : System.Web.UI.UserControl
{
   protected System.Web.UI.WebControls.Button Button1;
   protected System.Web.UI.WebControls.Panel Panel1;

   private void Page_Load(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
   {
      Response.Write(""WebUserControl1 :: Page_Load <BR>"");
   }

   private void Button1_Click(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
   {
      Response.Write(""WebUserControl1 :: Begin Button1_Click <BR>"");
      OnBubbleClick(e);
      Response.Write(""WebUserControl1 :: End Button1_Click <BR>"");
   }

   public event EventHandler BubbleClick;

   protected void OnBubbleClick(EventArgs e)
   {
      if(BubbleClick != null)
      {
         BubbleClick(this, e);
      }
   }           

   #region Web Form Designer generated code
   override protected void OnInit(EventArgs e)
   {
      InitializeComponent();
      base.OnInit(e);
   }

   private void InitializeComponent()
   {
      this.Button1.Click += new System.EventHandler(this.Button1_Click);
      this.Load += new System.EventHandler(this.Page_Load);

   }
   #endregion

}


The user control specifies a public event (BubbleClick) which declares a delegate. Anyone interested in the BubbleClick event can add an EventHandler method to execute when the event fires â just like the user control adds an EventHandler for when the Button fires the Click event.

In the OnBubbleClick event, we first check to see if anyone has attached to the event (BubbleClick != null), we can then invoke all the event handling methods by calling BubbleClick, passing through the EventArgs parameter and setting the user control (this) as the event sender. Notice we are also using Response.Write to follow the flow of execution.

An ASPX page can now put the user control to work.

<%@ Register TagPrefix=""ksa"" 
    TagName=""BubbleControl"" 
    Src=""WebUserControl1.ascx"" 
%>
<%@ Page language=""c#"" Codebehind=""WebForm1.aspx.cs"" 
    AutoEventWireup=""false"" Inherits=""aspnet.eventbubble.WebForm1"" 
%>
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"" >
<HTML>
    <HEAD>
    	<title>WebForm1</title>
    </HEAD>
    <body MS_POSITIONING=""GridLayout"">
    	<form id=""Form1"" method=""post"" runat=""server"">
    		<ksa:BubbleControl id=""BubbleControl"" runat=""server"" />
    	</form>
    </body>
</HTML>


In the code behind for the page.

public class WebForm1 : System.Web.UI.Page
{
   protected WebUserControl1 BubbleControl;

   private void Page_Load(object sender, System.EventArgs e)
   {
      Response.Write(""WebForm1 :: Page_Load <BR>"");
   }

   #region Web Form Designer generated code
   override protected void OnInit(EventArgs e)
   {
      InitializeComponent();
      base.OnInit(e);
   }

   private void InitializeComponent()
   {    
      this.Load += new System.EventHandler(this.Page_Load);
      BubbleControl.BubbleClick += new EventHandler(WebForm1_BubbleClick);
   }
   #endregion

   private void WebForm1_BubbleClick(object sender, EventArgs e)
   {
      Response.Write(""WebForm1 :: WebForm1_BubbleClick from "" + 
                     sender.GetType().ToString() + ""<BR>"");         
   }
}


Notice the parent page simply needs to add an event handler during InitializeComponent method. When we receive the event we will again use Reponse.Write to follow the flow of execution.

One word of warning: if at anytime events mysteriously stop work, check the InitializeComponent method to make sure the designer has not removed any of the code adding event handlers.

You'll squeeze some extra performance using the following syntax...

SELECT ID,Column1,Column2 FROM MyTable
Cross Apply [SeparateValues](@CommaSeparated, ',') s

starting a MIDlet (a Java application for mobile phones) when the phone is switched on is tricky at best without coding a small Symbian OS C++ module that will start it for you. If you want to try anyway, look at the PushRegistry class in the MIDP specs
(http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/apis/jsr118/). The Content Handling API might provide some way to do it too (http://java.sun.com/javame/reference/apis/jsr211). When you are ready to give up, do it in C++.
Backgrounding a MIDlet isn't hard. The phone's ""menu"" key will do it for you. Programatically, Canvas.setCurrent(null) has a good chance of working. Trying to trick the phone by providing a fully transparent GUI and not handling any keypad activity will absolutely not work. Creating and starting a separate Thread in the MIDlet should allow you to keep something running even after your overload of MIDlet.pauseApp() has been called by the application management system.
The real issue is that the MIDlet will not have any Inter Process Communication system unless you make one. The usual way of doing that is a loopback socket connection over which you transfer data. Not a nice or efficient way of simulating IPC. Sharing a RMS record can only be done from within the same MIDlet suite (you can package several MIDlets into the same .jar file), I think. The code to create a provider/consumer data flow over a file connection is even uglier and will raise security issues.


Without any more information about what you want to use it for, my answer is : maybe but you should probably not try.

The performance issue is most likely in the hashing, and you can perform some simple benchmarks to prove whether it's because of file IO or the algorithm itself.

But one of the first things you might try is:

provider1.ComputeHash(stream1.ToArray());


This should make the FileStream read the entire file and return an array of bytes. .ToArray() may invoke a faster method than the .Read() method that ComputeHash will call.

I found the whole thing pretty easy and it's a very elegant way to do AOP. However....

Careful with the performance though. Using interception creates a dynamic proxy that will definitely slow things down. Based on our benchmarks using a 500 Node computing farm we saw a performance decrease of about 30% by using interception in Windsor, this was outside what we were doing inside the interception as well (essentially logging method calls and params passed in to our methdods). and simply removing the interception sped the whole app up quite a bit. 

Careful you don't make your expensive calls really expensive. :) If I were you I would look to cache at a different level, probably by implementing an IRepository type pattern and then backing that with various caching strategies where appropriate. 

Good luck,

I would just write out the sizeof() division explicitly when I want it. If I were to make it a function, I would want to make it clear in its definition that it's expecting an array.

template<typename T,int SIZE>
inline size_t array_size(const T (&array)[SIZE])

}


The above is similar to xtofl's, except it guards against passing a pointer to it (that says point to a dynamically allocated array) and getting the wrong answer by mistake.

EDIT: Simplified as per JohnMcG.
EDIT: inline.

Unfortunately, the above does not provide a compile time answer (even if the compiler does inline & optimize it to be a constant under the hood), so cannot be used as a compile time constant expression. i.e. It cannot be used as size to declare a static array. Under C++0x, this problem go away if one replaces the keyword inline by constexpr (constexpr is inline implicitly).

constexpr size_t array_size(const T (&array)[SIZE])


jwfearn's solution work for compile time, but involve having a typedef which effectively ""saved"" the array size in the declaration of a new name. The array size is then worked out by initialising a constant via that new name. In such case, one may as well simply save the array size into a constant from the start.

Martin York's posted solution also work under compile time, but involve using the non-standard typeof() operator. The work around to that is either wait for C++0x and use decltype (by which time one wouldn't actually need it for this problem as we'll have constexpr). Another alternative is to use Boost.Typeof, in which case we'll end up with

#include <boost/typeof/typeof.hpp>

template<typename T>
struct ArraySize
{
    private:    static T x;
    public:     enum { size = sizeof(T)/sizeof(*x)};
};
template<typename T>
struct ArraySize<T*> {};


and is used by writing

ArraySize<BOOST_TYPEOF(foo)>::size


where foo is the name of an array.

The issue here is more of a ""why do you need to know"" - it has bearing on the answer.  Really, there is no API because from a OS behavior point of view, what matters is if the user is an administrator or not - how they choose to protect themselves as admin is their problem.

coverage report


Another option is to use Matlab's profiler. The command is profile, it can also be used to track dependencies.  To use profile, you could do 

>> profile on   % turn profiling on
>> foo;         % entry point to your matlab function or script
>> profile off  % turn profiling off
>> profview     % view the report


If profiler is not available, then perhaps the following two functions are (for pre-MATLAB 2015a):


depfun
depdir


For example, 

>> deps = depfun('foo');


gives a structure, deps, that contains all the dependencies of foo.m.

From answers 2, and 3, newer versions of MATLAB (post 2015a) use matlab.codetools.requiredFilesAndProducts instead.

See answers 

EDIT:

Caveats thanks to @Mike Katz comments


  
  Remember that the Profiler will only
  show you files that were actually used
  in those runs, so if you don't go
  through every branch, you may have
  additional dependencies. The
  dependency report is a good tool, but
  only resolves static dependencies on
  the path and just for the files in a
  single directory. 
  Depfun is more reliable but gives you
  every possible thing it can think of,
  and still misses LOAD's and EVAL's.

It's not as short as the ""@hash{@array} = ..."" solutions, but those ones require the hash and array to already be defined somewhere else, whereas this one can take an anonymous array and return an anonymous hash.

What this does is take each element in the array and pair it up with a ""1"". When this list of (key, 1, key, 1, key 1) pairs get assigned to a hash, the odd-numbered ones become the hash's keys, and the even-numbered ones become the respective values.

C specifies the following specifiers for variables: auto, extern, register, static.

Storage
The storage duration determines how long your variable will live in ram.
There are three types of storage duration: static, automatic and dynamic.

static
If your variable is declared at file scope, or with an extern or static specifier, it will have static storage. The variable will exist for as long as the program is executing. No execution time is spent to create these variables.

automatic
If the variable is declared in a function, but without the extern or static specifier, it has automatic storage. The variable will exist only while you are executing the function.  Once you return, the variable no longer exist.  Automatic storage is typically done on the stack.  It is a very fast operation to create these variables (simply increment the stack pointer by the size).

dynamic
If you use malloc (or new in C++) you are using dynamic storage.  This storage will exist until you call free (or delete). This is the most expensive way to create storage, as the system must manage allocation and deallocation dynamically.

Linkage
Linkage specifies who can see and reference the variable. There are three types of linkage: internal linkage, external linkage and no linkage.

no linkage
This variable is only visible where it was declared. Typically applies to variables declared in a function.

internal linkage
This variable will be visible to all the functions within the file (called a translation unit), but other files will not know it exists.

external linkage
The variable will be visible to other translation units.  These are often thought of as ""global variables"".

Here is a table describing the storage and linkage characteristics based on the specifiers


  Storage Class   Function            File 
  Specifier        Scope              Scope

Maintenable code: I think that the same rules of any other OO languages apply. Some flex-specific rules I'm use to follow: use strong typed variables, always consider dispatching events as the way for your UI components talk each other (a little more initial work, very flexible and decoupled later).

Frameworks: looked at it, read the documentation.. very nice, but I still feel that their complications are not balanced by the benefits they provide. Anyway I'd like to change my mind on this point..

Talking with server: Right now I'm using BlazeDS, it works very well.. there are many tutorials on the subject out there, if you find any trouble setting up it I would be happy to help.

Latency: Do you mean in client/server comunications? If so, you should explore the various type of channels BlazeDS implements.. pull-only, two-way http polling, near real-time on http (comet).. if you need more, LiveCycle Data Services ES, the commrcial implementation from which BlazeDS is born, among other things offer another protocol called RTMP, it isn't http-tunnelled so there can be problem with firewalls and proxies, but it offers better performance (there is a free closed-source version of LCDS). I use the standard http channels in intranet environments, and found no real performance problems even with large datasets.

There's so many metrics to capture - it's nuts.

I'll save you all the stuff I've been through - what's by far been the most successful for me is just creating an Order object with ""NotCheckedOut"" status and then adding items to it and the user adds items. This lets users have more than one cart and allows you to mine the tar out of the Orders table. It also is quite easy to transact the order - just change the status.

Persisting ""as they go"" also allows the user to come back and finish the cart off if they can't, for some reason. Forgiveness is massive with eCommerce.

textInput.setSelection(4, 15);


There is no need to know the type of an object in order to interact with it. Of course you lose type checking at compile time, but that's really not much of an issue, you just have to be extra careful.

It's rather confusing, so I recommend staying clear of it. Today, you use sessions by accessing the global variable $_SESSION (It's an array). You can put object instances in there, but you need to load the class definitions for those objects before starting the session on the next page. Using autoload can help you out here.

You must start a session before you can use $_SESSION. Since starting the session sends headers, you can't have any output before. This can be solved in one of two ways:
Either you always begin the session at the start of your script. Or you buffer all output, and send it out at the end of the script.


  One good idea is to regenerate the session on each request. this makes hijack much less likely.


That's (slightly) bad advice, since it can make the site inaccessible. You should regenerate the session-id whenever a users privileges changes though. In general that means, whenever they log in. This is to prevent session-fixation (A form of session-hijacking). See this recent thread @ Sitepoint for more on the subject.

Using cookiebased sessions only is OK, but if you regenerate session id's on login, it doesn't add any additional security, and it lowers accessibility a bit.

In Progress 4GL you'd use it something like this:

crowid = ROWID(customer).


or:

FIND customer WHERE ROWID(customer) = crowid EXCLUSIVE-LOCK.


Checking the Progress SQL Reference [PDF] shows ROWID is also available in SQL as a Progress extension.  You'd use it like so:

IIS 7.0 is much more robust host and it comes with numerous features that make debugging easy. Failed requests tracing, worker process recycling, process orphaning  to name a few.
IIS 7.0 gives you more option to specify what should happen with the worker process in certain circumstances. 
If you host your service under IIS it doesn't have a worker process assigned to it until the very first request. This is something that was a desired behaviour from my perspective but it might be different in your case. Windows Service gives you the ability to start your service in a more deterministic way.
From my experience WAS itself doesn't provide increased reliability. It's biggest advantage is that it exposes the richness of IIS to applications that use protocols different than HTTP. By different I mean: TCP, named pipes and MSMQ.
The only disadvantage of using WAS that I'm aware of is that the address your service is exposed at needs to be compliant with some sort of pattern. How it looks like in case of MSMQ is described here

  The default behavior for ApplicationContext implementations is to eagerly pre-instantiate all singleton beans at startup. Pre-instantiation means that an ApplicationContext will eagerly create and configure all of its singleton beans as part of its initialization process. Generally this is a good thing, because it means that any errors in the configuration or in the surrounding environment will be discovered immediately (as opposed to possibly hours or even days down the line).
  
  However, there are times when this behavior is not what is wanted. If you do not want a singleton bean to be pre-instantiated when using an ApplicationContext, you can selectively control this by marking a bean definition as lazy-initialized. A lazily-initialized bean indicates to the IoC container whether or not a bean instance should be created at startup or when it is first requested.
  
  When configuring beans via XML, this lazy loading is controlled by the 'lazy-init' attribute on the [bean element] ; for example: 


<bean id=""lazy"" class=""com.foo.ExpensiveToCreateBean"" lazy-init=""true""/>


But, unless your beans are using up resources like file locks or database connections, I wouldn't worry too much about simple memory overhead if it is easier for you to have this one configuration for multiple (but different) profiles.

My personal top3: 


violating the strict aliasing rule
violating the strict aliasing rule
violating the strict aliasing rule

:-)


Edit Here is a little example that does it wrong twice:

(assume 32 bit ints and little endian)

float funky_float_abs (float a)
{
  unsigned int temp = *(unsigned int *)&a;
  temp &= 0x7fffffff;
  return *(float *)&temp;
}


That code tries to get the absolute value of a float by bit-twiddling with the sign bit directly in the representation of a float.

However, the result of creating a pointer to an object by casting from one type to another is not valid C. The compiler may assume that pointers to different types don't point to the same chunk of memory. This is true for all kind of pointers except void* and char* (sign-ness does not matter). 

In the case above I do that twice. Once to get an int-alias for the float a, and once to convert the value back to float. 

There are three valid ways to do the same.

Use a char or void pointer during the cast. These always alias to anything, so they are safe.

float funky_float_abs (float a)
{
  float temp_float = a;
  // valid, because it's a char pointer. These are special.
  unsigned char * temp = (unsigned char *)&temp_float;
  temp[3] &= 0x7f;
  return temp_float;
}


Use memcopy. Memcpy takes void pointers, so it will force aliasing as well. 

float funky_float_abs (float a)
{
  int i;
  float result;
  memcpy (&i, &a, sizeof (int));
  i &= 0x7fffffff;
  memcpy (&result, &i, sizeof (int));
  return result;
}


The third valid way: use unions. This is explicitly not undefined since C99:

float funky_float_abs (float a)
{
  union 
  {
     unsigned int i;
     float f;
  } cast_helper;

  cast_helper.f = a;
  cast_helper.i &= 0x7fffffff;
  return cast_helper.f;
}

5026,99010,8123.0,2008-09-19T02:36:24Z,98650,373,"A typical situation you encounter strict aliasing problems is when overlaying a struct (like a device/network msg) onto a buffer of the word size of your system (like a pointer to uint32_ts or uint16_ts). When you overlay a struct onto such a buffer, or a buffer onto such a struct through pointer casting you can easily violate strict aliasing rules.

So in this kind of setup, if I want to send a message to something I'd have to have two incompatible pointers pointing to the same chunk of memory. I might then naively code something like this:

struct Msg
{
   unsigned int a;
   unsigned int b;
};

void SendWord(uint32_t*);

int main()
{
   // Get a 32-bit buffer from the system
   uint32_t* buff = malloc(sizeof(Msg));

   // Alias that buffer through message
   Msg* msg = (Msg*)(buff);

   // Send a bunch of messages    
   for (int i =0; i < 10; ++i)
   {
      msg->a = i;
      msg->b = i+1;
      SendWord(buff[0] );
      SendWord(buff[1] );   
   }
}


The strict aliasing rule makes this setup illegal: dereferencing a pointer that aliases another of an incompatible type is undefined behavior. Unfortunately, you can still code this way, maybe* get some warnings, have it compile fine, only to have weird unexpected behavior when you run the code. 

*(gcc appears pretty inconsistent in its ability to give aliasing warnings, giving us a friendly warning here but not here)

To see why this behavior is undefined, we have to think about what the strict aliasing rule buys the compiler. Basically, with this rule, it doesn't have to think about inserting instructions to refresh the contents of buff every run of the loop. Instead, when optimizing, with some annoyingly unenforced assumptions about aliasing, it can omit those instructions, load buff[0] and buff[1] once before the loop is run, and speed up the body of the loop. Before strict aliasing was introduced, the compiler had to live in a state of paranoia that the contents of buff could change at anytime from anywhere by anybody. So to get an extra performance edge, and assuming most people don't type-pun pointers, the strict aliasing rule was introduced.

Keep in mind, if you think the example is contrived, this might even happen if you're passing a buffer to another function doing the sending for you, if instead you have.

 void SendMessage(uint32_t* buff, size_t size32)
 {
    for (int i = 0; i < size32; ++i) 
    {
       SendWord(buff[i]);
    }
 }


And rewrote our earlier loop to take advantage of this convenient function

   for (int i =0; i < 10; ++i)
   {
      msg->a = i;
      msg->b = i+1;
      SendMessage(buff, 2);
   }


The compiler may or may not be able to or smart enough to try to inline SendMessage and it may or may not decide to load or not load buff again. If SendMessage is part of another API that's compiled separately, it probably has instructions to load buff's contents. Then again, maybe you're in C++ and this is some templated header only implementation that the compiler thinks it can inline. Or maybe it's just something you wrote in your .c file for your own convenience. Anyway undefined behavior might still ensue. Even when we know some of what's happening under the hood, it's still a violation of the rule so no well defined behavior is guaranteed. So just by wrapping in a function that takes our word delimited buffer doesn't necessarily help.

So how do I get around this?


Use a union. Most compilers support this without complaining about strict aliasing. This is allowed in C99 and explicitly allowed in C11.



    union {
        Msg msg;
        unsigned int asBuffer[sizeof(Msg)/sizeof(unsigned int)];
    };



You can disable strict aliasing in your compiler (f[no-]strict-aliasing in gcc)) 
You can use char* for aliasing instead of your system's word. The rules allow an exception for char* (including signed char and unsigned char). It's always assumed that char* aliases other types. However this won't work the other way: there's no assumption that your struct aliases a buffer of chars.


Beginner beware

This is only one potential minefield when overlaying two types onto each other. You should also learn about endianness, word alignment, and how to deal with alignment issues through packing structs correctly.

From the MDN forums thread you mention, it seems to me you actually want to measure how your code uses the COM component.

You need unit/scenario testing to ensure that your code is calling the right methods/properties at the right time.

Imho, the right way to do this would be to write a mock layer for the COM object and test that you are calling all the methods/properties as expected.

  someProcessing(element);
  ....
}


2) For the new style java loops like for(Element element: ElementsList) it is better to use normal meanigful name

Java Example:

for(Element element: ElementsList) {
  someProcessing(element);
  ....
}


3) If it is possible with the language you use, convert the loop to use iterator

For the best explanation dig up a copy of TCP/IP Illustrated by Stevens 



But, as I understand it, because the application did not properly close the connection (that is BOTH client and server sent their FIN/ACK sequences) the socket you were listening on cannot be reused until the connection is considered dead, the so called 2MSL timeout. The value of 1 MSL can vary by operating system, but its usually a least a minute, and usually more like 5. 

The best advice I have heard to avoid this condition (apart from always closing all sockets properly on exit) is to set the SO_LINGER tcp option to 0 on your server socket during the listen() phase. As freespace pointed out, in java this is the setReuseAddress(true) method.

So, for instance, if you have two block-display elements, A, followed by B beneath it, and A has a bottom-margin of 3em, while B has a top-margin of 2em, then the distance between them will be 3em.

If you set a border or padding, this prevents the collapsing from occurring.  In the above example, the distance between the two elements will then be 5em.

If you don't set any margins, then there won't be any margins to collapse.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with the element type in use - it is applicable to all element types, not just <div> elements.

If I do project based billing, then I tend to be a little more formal.  Meaning that my contract lays out the main project features as well as possible limitations etc.  I go over it in detail prior to signing, then that becomes my blueprint.

I do allow for changes along the way, but I make those a little more formal as well with signed change request forms describing the change and the modified project costs.  

On a 6 month to 1 year deal, I may show progress about once every 3 to 4 weeks; or at milestone developments at which point I do incremental billing.  This is probably closer to being a waterfall approach than anything else.

If I am billing for time and materials then I tend to be a lot more flexible and have a lot more communication with the client.  I may be showing something new every day, or at the very least, once a week.  I basically try to show the result of each task I finish.  The type of clients that want to bill hourly tend to like this format.  This tends to be closer to an agile approach.

At the end of the day you just have to go with what works best in your situation.

EDIT: 'exit' should not be called from the signal handler either!

As pointed out by fizzer, calling _Exit in the above is a sledge hammer approach for signals such as HUP and TERM.  Ideally, when these signals are caught a flag with ""volatile sig_atomic_t"" type can be used to notify the main program that it should exit.

Agreed in that clutter can be a problem.  I tend to use Spaces heavily when developing in XCode (put XCode in one space, Interface Builder in another space, Instruments in a third space).  If you don't have Leopard (and thus, no spaces), then use Command-H to hide your active window.  Using that tends to clean things up quite a bit (however it'd be nice if you could command-h automagically the current window when command-tab'ing to another app).
I'm liking XCode more and more.  I hate Visual Studio - I find it to be unstable, slow, and well, just kind of a crappy IDE.  Comparatively I've found XCode to be fast, stable, and I like how it organizes and filters your files.  I'm not too up on my XCode shortcuts, but I'm hoping there's a way I can quick-switch from one class to another (similar to ctrl +n shortcut in ReSharper).  Intellisense could be better with regards to how it displays to the user, but I really like how it essentially creates a template and you can ctrl + / to jump to the next argument in a message.
I'm hating the documentation in XCode.  The help system sucks, and for whatever reason it never finds what I'm searching for.  I end up just googling for anything I need to know... I hope they improve the documentation.  This is my biggest beef right now.
Not quite there yet, as I'm going through the full Cocoa framework for Mac desktops.  So far I'm really, really liking what I see.  One thing I will say is that it would be nice if the iPhone SDK allowed for garbage collection...
Objective-C - I've never used it, this is my first foray into it.  At first I was kinda wierded out by the syntax and the square brackets for messaging, but it's really growing on me.  It's so quick to skim a method and see the message calls that method makes.  The more I use it, the more Objective-C just feels nice... however templating/generics would be a welcome addition to the language.


All in all, my foray into Mac development has been enjoyable, and I'm excited to start working (today! yay!) on some actual mac/iphone projects.

Superfish which also includes a version of jQuery
CSS Friendly Control Adaptors download DLL and .browsers file (into /bin and /App_Browsers folders respectively)
ASP.NET SiteMap (a .sitemap XML file and siteMap provider entry in web.config)


My finished Masterpage.master has the following head tag:

        $(document).ready(function() {
        $('ul.AspNet-Menu').superfish();
        });

Which is basically all the stuff needed for the jQuery Superfish menu to work. Inside the page (where the menu goes) looks like this (based on these instructions):

<asp:SiteMapDataSource ID=""SiteMapDataSource"" runat=""server""
    ShowStartingNode=""false"" />
<asp:Menu ID=""Menu1"" runat=""server"" 
    DataSourceID=""SiteMapDataSource""
    Orientation=""Horizontal"" CssClass=""sf-menu"">

Based on the documentation, this seems like it SHOULD work - but it doesn't. The reason is that the CssClass=""sf-menu"" gets overwritten when the Menu is rendered and the <ul> tag gets a class=""AspNet-Menu"". I thought the line $('ul.AspNet-Menu').superfish(); would help, but it didn't. 

ONE MORE THING

Although it is a hack (and please someone point me to the correct solution) I was able to get it working by opening the superfish.css file and search and replacing sf-menu with AspNet-Menu... and voila! the menu appeared. I thought there would be some configuration setting in the asp:Menu control where I could set the <ul> class but didn't find any hints via google.

Flash Pros


The ""artistic"" interface is much better, in my opinion. If you have artists and designers that are used to using Illustrator or Photoshop, this is pretty straight forward.
The way their environment integrates frame-based movie timelines is pretty slick and has been for years. It makes it very easy to integrate and layer many different animated elements and sounds into your movie or animation.
All coding is done in the JavaScript-esque language ActionScript, so the learning curve for  the syntax at least is pretty low for non-microsoft developers.
Online support. There are years and years worth of posts that can help you figure out what you need to do to get what you want in Flash.


Silverlight Pros


It uses .Net as a back end. If you have a lot of .Net developers, you'll be able to leverage the .Net framework which is a much more powerful set of tools, programmatically speaking.
Easier to debug. In my experience it's easier to debug than Actionscript, largely due to the superior IDE.
Bringing me to the IDE. The coding IDE is vastly superior to Flash's clunky, cobbled together, fancified textpad. It has intellisense, auto-complete, etc.


Flash Cons


In my extensive Flash experience, If you're making a highly interactive app, it can be buggy as all get out. Some of the bugs bordering on nonsense, the work arounds being hackish at best.
The IDE sucks. Period. It's notepad with some poorly implemented intellisense-esque keyword identification.
The language falls on it's face at times. I've seen instances where all of a sudden a var got all type-sensitive on me, where it wasn't just two stanzas prior. My fault? Maybe. Probably. But nonetheless I've seen some weird behavior from ActionScript, whereas C# has always done what I've told it to.
No real standard way of doing things. No ""best-practice put your code here"" way to do things. Flash lets you put code on anything. A frame, a MovieClip, an object, an array... sure whatever, just pop some functions on some stuff and party! This makes finding bugs in someone else's app a real chore.


Silverlight Cons


Not a lot of documentation yet, in my opinion.
Substandard ""artist"" interface by comparision. If you're going for a certain look, it may be harder for your designer to acheive.
If you're not used to XAML, layouts can be a real pain in the butt. If you've never used XAML, and you've got a sort timeline to get this thing done, you best be prepared to put in some extra time, or be okay with a less than stellar look and feel. It's not quite as easy to get the look that you want with XAML as it is in Flash.


Again, all of this is in my own opinion and from my experiences. Other people may have different opinions.

If you have a few designers and some Flash experience, go with flash. If you want to learn something new, pad your resume, and you've got nothing but .Net experience, go with Silverlight.

In the end, do whatever it is that makes you like coming to work. (as long as it meets your deadlines. lol)

<Window x:Class=""Example.CustomerWindow"" ...>
    <Window.CommandBindings>
        <CommandBinding Command=""ApplicationCommands.Save""
                        CanExecute=""SaveCanExecute""
                        Executed=""SaveExecuted"" />
    </Window.CommandBindings>
    <StackPanel>
        <TextBox Text=""{Binding FirstName, ValidatesOnDataErrors=true, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}"" />
        <TextBox Text=""{Binding LastName, ValidatesOnDataErrors=true, UpdateSourceTrigger=PropertyChanged}"" />
        <Button Command=""ApplicationCommands.Save"" IsDefault=""True"">Save</Button>
        <TextBlock Text=""{Binding Error}""/>
    </StackPanel>
</Window>


This creates a Window with two TextBoxes where you can edit the first and last name of a customer. The ""Save"" button is only enabled if no validation errors have occurred. The TextBlock beneath the button shows the current errors, so the user knows what's up.

The default ErrorTemplate is a thin red border around the erroneous Control. If that doesn't fit into you visual concept, look at Validation in Windows Presentation Foundation article on CodeProject for an in-depth look into what can be done about that.

To get the window to actually work, there has to be a bit infrastructure in the Window and the Customer.

Code Behind

// The CustomerWindow class receives the Customer to display
// and manages the Save command
public class CustomerWindow : Window
{
    private Customer CurrentCustomer;
    public CustomerWindow(Customer c) 
    {
        // store the customer for the bindings
        DataContext = CurrentCustomer = c;
        InitializeComponent();
    }

    private void SaveCanExecute(object sender, CanExecuteRoutedEventArgs e)
    {
        e.CanExecute = ValidationEngine.Validate(CurrentCustomer);
    }

    private void SaveExecuted(object sender, ExecutedRoutedEventArgs e) 
    {
        CurrentCustomer.Save();
    }
}

public class Customer : IDataErrorInfo, INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    // holds the actual value of FirstName
    private string FirstNameBackingStore;
    // the accessor for FirstName. Only accepts valid values.
    public string FirstName {
        get { return FirstNameBackingStore; }
        set {
            FirstNameBackingStore = value;
            ValidationEngine.Validate(this);
            OnPropertyChanged(""FirstName"");
        }
    }
    // similar for LastName        

    string IDataErrorInfo.Error {
        get { return String.Join(""\n"", BrokenRules.Values); }
    }

    string IDataErrorInfo.this[string columnName]
    {
        get { return BrokenRules[columnName]; }
    }
}


An obvious improvement would be to move the IDataErrorInfo implementation up the class hierarchy, since it only depends on the ValidationEngine, but not the business object.

While this is indeed more code than the simple example you provided, it also has quite a bit more of functionality than only checking for validity. This gives you fine grained, and automatically updated indications to the user about validation problems and automatically disables the ""Save"" button as long as the user tries to enter invalid data.

You can also embed the stylesheet within the HTML document.  The best practice in web design is to separate out the CSS into a separate stylesheet.  The reason for this is that the CSS stylesheet exists for the purpose of defining the presentation style of the document.  The HTML file exists to define the structure and content of the document.  And perhaps you may have JavaScript files which exist to add additional behavior to the document.

Keeping the presentation, markup, and behavior separate creates a cleaner design.

From a practical perspective, if you have a single external CSS stylesheet the browser can cache it.  If multiple pages on your site have the same look and feel, they can use the same external stylesheet which only needs to be downloaded once by the web browser.  This will make your network bandwidth bills lower as well as creating a faster end user experience.

But the rate of change (as in ""progress"") is not increasing - if anything, it is decreasing. What we are seeing is a widening of the field.

Take a simple example: Once upon a time there was HTML/1. Then came HTML/2 and that was progress. Now we have HTML/4, HTML/5, XHTML/1, Flash, Silverlight, and on and on. Any one of these is progress, but each is progress in a different direction and all are in active use.

Stay on top of this? Forget it - it's not possible. On the other hand, good IT folks can pick up a new language or a new technology in a few weeks at most - no big deal. Try to pick out the genuinely new ideas and learn about them. Ignore all the specific technologies (IIS 7, SQL Server 2008, etc.) unless and until you need them.

Continuing the Internet as an example, the last real innovation were the ideas behind Web 2.0. I took the opportunity to learn Ruby at the same time - did a couple of small, throw-away projects in Ruby on Rails. If a project in this area comes along, the ideas will be the same in whatever environment.

One does occasionally get frustrated. It's not always easy to pick out the truly new ideas amidst all the marketing hype.

All the best...

Any time you need to debug a truly ugly problem windbg has better technology to do it with than Visual Studio.  Windbg has a more powerful scripting language and allows you to write DLLs to automate difficult problems.  It will install gflags.exe, which gives you better control over the heap for debugging memory overwrites.  

You don't actually need to run the install, you can just copy the files over and be ready to go.  Also it installs adsplus.vb, so you can take mini-dumps of running processes.  It is also very easy to setup to perform remote debugging.  There is nothing better than being able to debug a problem from your own desk instead of fighting the 15"" monitor that flickers on a test PC.  

For day to day code writing I use Visual Studio, but once you need to start debugging problems from other computers or find yourself in a very ugly situation, windbg is the only way to go.  Spending some time learning windbg is a great investment.  Also if you look at crash dumps there are two great resources, http://www.dumpanalysis.org/blog and http://blogs.msdn.com/ntdebugging/default.aspx that do all their debugging using windbg.

If your structure has formally created primary keys (which it should, I never create a table without a primary key), those are by definition indexed becasue a primary key is required to have a unique index on it. People often forget that they have to index the foreign keys becasue an index is not automatically created when you set up the foreign key relationsship.  Since the purpose of a foreign key is to give you a field to join on, most foreign keys should probably be indexed.

Indexes once created need to be maintained. If you have a lot of data change activity, they can get fragmented and slow performance and need to be refreshed. Read in Books online about indexes. You can also find the syntax for the create index statement there.

Indexes are a balancing act, every index you add usually will add time to data inserts, updates and deletes but can potentially speed up selects and joins in complex inserts, updates and deletes. There is no one formula for what are the best indexes although the rule of thumb above is a good place to start.

Sometimes there's a manual bit manipulation hack to convert the character from upper ASCII to the appropriate unicode char, but since the ellipsis wasn't in most of the widely used extended ASCII codepages, that's unlikely to work here.

What you really want to do is use the Encoding.GetString(Byte[]) method, with the proper encoding. Put your value into a byte array, then GetString to get the C# native string for the character.

  unicode([object[, encoding [, errors]]])
  
  Return the Unicode string version of object using one of the following modes:
  
  If encoding and/or errors are given, unicode() will decode the
     object which can either be an 8-bit string or a character buffer
     using the codec for encoding. The encoding parameter is a string
     giving the name of an encoding; if the encoding is not known,
     LookupError is raised. Error handling is done according to
     errors; this specifies the treatment of characters which are
     invalid in the input encoding. If errors is 'strict' (the
     default), a ValueError is raised on errors, while a value of
     'ignore' causes errors to be silently ignored, and a value of
     'replace' causes the official Unicode replacement character,
     U+FFFD, to be used to replace input characters which cannot be
     decoded. See also the codecs module.
  
  If no optional parameters are given, unicode() will mimic the
     behaviour of str() except that it returns Unicode strings
     instead of 8-bit strings. More precisely, if object is a Unicode
     string or subclass it will return that Unicode string without
     any additional decoding applied.
  
  For objects which provide a __unicode__() method, it will call
     this method without arguments to create a Unicode string. For
     all other objects, the 8-bit string version or representation is
     requested and then converted to a Unicode string using the codec
     for the default encoding in 'strict' mode.
  
  New in version 2.0. Changed in version 2.2: Support for __unicode__() added. 


So, when you call unicode(r, 'utf-8'), it requires an 8-bit string or a character buffer as the first argument, so it coerces your object using the __str__() method, and attempts to decode that using the utf-8 codec. Without the utf-8, the unicode() function looks for a for a __unicode__() method on your object, and not finding it, calls the __str__() method, as you suggested, attempting to use the default codec to convert to unicode.

Also, you need to go to Martin Fowler's site. He has a lot of good information about testing as well.

We are pretty big on TDD so I will answer the questions in that light.


  Should tests be in the same project as application logic?


Typically we keep our tests in the same solution, but we break tests into seperate DLL's/Projects that mirror the DLL's/Projects they are testing, but maintain namespaces with the tests being in a sub namespace. Example: Common / Common.Tests


  Should I have test classes to mirror my logic classes or should I have only as many test classes as I feel I need to have?


Yes, your tests should be created before any classes are created, and by definition you should only test a single unit in isolation. Therefore you should have a test class for each class in your solution.


  How should I name my test classes, methods, and projects (if they go in different projects)


I like to emphasize that behavior is what is being tested so I typically name test classes after the SUT. For example if I had a User class I would name the test class like so:

public class UserBehavior


Methods should be named to describe the behavior that you expect.

public void ShouldBeAbleToSetUserFirstName()


Projects can be named however you want but usually you want it to be fairly obvious which project it is testing. See previous answer about project organization.


  Should private, protected, and internal methods be tested, or just those that are publicly accessible?


Again you want tests to assert expected behavior as if you were a 3rd party consumer of the objects being tested. If you test internal implementation details then your tests will be brittle. You want your test to give you the freedom to refactor without worrying about breaking existing functionality. If your test know about implementation details then you will have to change your tests if those details change.


  Should unit and integration tests be separated?


Yes, unit tests need to be isolated from acceptance and integration tests. Separation of concerns applies to tests as well.


  Is there a good reason not to have 100% test coverage?


I wouldn't get to hung up on the 100% code coverage thing. 100% code coverage tends to imply some level of quality in the tests, but that is a myth. You can have terrible tests and still get 100% coverage. I would instead rely on a good Test First mentality. If you always write a test before you write a line of code then you will ensure 100% coverage so it becomes a moot point.

In general if you focus on describing the full behavioral scope of the class then you will have nothing to worry about. If you make code coverage a metric then lazy programmers will simply do just enough to meet that mark and you will still have crappy tests. Instead rely heavily on peer reviews where the tests are reviewed as well.

The Java EE product provider is typically an application-server, web-server, or database-system vendor who provides classes that implement the interfaces defined in the specifications. These vendors compete on implementations of the Java EE specifications.  

When a company requires Java EE experience what are they really asking for is experience using the technologies that make up Java EE. Frequently, a company will only be using a subset of the Java EE technologies.

eval(""local_variables.collect { |l| [l, eval(l)] }"", Binding.of_caller)


But that's quite a big hack. The right answer is probably to extend Ruby to allow some inspection of the call stack. I'm not sure if some of the new Ruby implementations will allow this, but I do remember a backlash against Binding.of_caller because it will make optimizations much harder.

(To be honest, I don't understand this backlash: as long as the interpreter records enough information about the optimizations performed, Binding.of_caller should be able to work, although perhaps slowly.)

Update

Ok, I figured it out. Longish code follows:

class Foo < Exception

    expected_file, expected_line = caller(1).first.split(':')[0,2]

    # Start tracing until we see our caller.
    set_trace_func(proc do |event, file, line, id, binding, kls|
      if file == expected_file && line == expected_line
        # Found it: Save the binding and stop tracing

Although you could manipulate the default `make` target to run your tests,

make


would run all the tests.
You should use the ""check"" target instead,

By doing that,
the tests are only started when you run


make check


You can then easily configure KDevelop

Since you are using automake (through KDevelop),
you don't need to write the ""check"" target yourself.
Instead, just edit your `Makefile.am` and set some variables:

5567,107450,3153.0,2008-09-20T06:54:01Z,107390,484,"HTTP PUT:

PUT puts a file or resource at a specific URI, and exactly at that URI. If there's already a file or resource at that URI, PUT replaces that file or resource.  If there is no file or resource there, PUT creates one. PUT is idempotent, but paradoxically PUT responses are not cacheable.

HTTP 1.1 RFC location for PUT

HTTP POST: 

POST sends data to a specific URI and expects the resource at that URI to handle the request.  The web server at this point can determine what to do with the data in the context of the specified resource. The POST method is not idempotent, however POST responses are cacheable so long as the server sets the appropriate Cache-Control and Expires headers.

The official HTTP RFC specifies POST to be:


Annotation of existing resources;
Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list,
   or similar group of articles;
Providing a block of data, such as the result of submitting a
    form, to a data-handling process;
Extending a database through an append operation. 


HTTP 1.1 RFC location for POST

Difference between POST and PUT:

The RFC itself explains the core difference:


  The fundamental difference between the
  POST and PUT requests is reflected in
  the different meaning of the
  Request-URI. The URI in a POST request
  identifies the resource that will
  handle the enclosed entity. That
  resource might be a data-accepting
  process, a gateway to some other
  protocol, or a separate entity that
  accepts annotations. In contrast, the
  URI in a PUT request identifies the
  entity enclosed with the request --
  the user agent knows what URI is
  intended and the server MUST NOT
  attempt to apply the request to some
  other resource. If the server desires
  that the request be applied to a
  different URI, it MUST send a 301 (Moved Permanently) response; the user agent MAY then make
  its own decision regarding whether or not to redirect the request.


Using the right method, unrelated aside:

One benefit of REST ROA vs SOAP is that when using HTTP REST ROA, it encourages the proper usage of the HTTP verbs/methods.  So for example you would only use PUT when you want to create a resource at that exact location.  And you would never use GET to create or modify a resource.

checks out a clean copy of the source into an empty directory

compiles source into a product
creates an archive (zip or tarball or whatever) of the product
cleans up: deletes everything but the archive


Then you have a one-step process to create a release with an easily identifiable version.  It also helps you avoid giving someone a build from your own working copy, which may have changes that were never checked into source control.

Databinding legacy ASP.NET controls - if an alternative is not available or a temporary solution is needed.
View logic that requires recursion to create some kind of nested or hierarchical HTML.
View logic that uses temporary variables. I refuse to define local variables in my tag soup! I'd want them as properties on the view class at the very least.
Logic that is specific only to one view or model and does not belong to an HtmlHelper. As a side note I don't think an HtmlHelper should know about any 'Model' classes. Its fine if it knows about the classes defined inside a model (such as IEnumerable, but I dont think for instance you should ever have an HtmlHelper that takes a ProductModel.
HtmlHelper methods end up becoming visible from ALL your views when you type Html+dot and i really want to minimize this list as much as possible.
What if I want to write code that uses HtmlGenericControl and other classes in that namespace to generate my HTML in an object oriented way (or I have existing code that does that that I want to port).
What if I'm planning on using a different view engine in future. I might want to keep some of the logic aside from the tag soup to make it easier to reuse later.
What if I want to be able to rename my Model classes and have it automatically refactor my view without having to go to the view.aspx and change the class name.
What if I'm coordinating with an HTML designer who I don't trust to not mess up the 'tag soup' and want to write anythin beyond very basic looping in the .aspx.cs file.
If you want to sort the data based upon the view's default sort option. I really dont think the controller should be sorting data for you if you have multiple sorting options accessible only from the view.
You actually want to debug the view logic in code that actuallky looks like .cs and not HTML.
You want to write code that may be factored out later and reused elsewhere - you're just not sure yet.
You want to prototype what may become a new HtmlHelper but you haven't yet decided whether its generic enough or not to warrant creating an HtmlHelper. (basically same as previous point)
You want to create a helper method to render a partial view, but need to create a model for it by plucking data out of the main page's view and creating a model for the partial control which is based on the current loop iteration.
You believe that programming complex logic IN A SINGLE FUNCTION is an out of date and unmaintainable practice. 
You did it before RC1 and didn't run into any problems !!


Yes! Some views should not need codebehind at all.

Yes! It sucks to get a stupid .designer file created in addition to .cs file.

Yes! Its kind of annoying to get those little + signs next to each view.

BUT - It's really not that hard to NOT put data access logic in the code-behind.

They are most certainly NOT evil.

This way, I can use a single cache key per forum, and it takes very little effort to clear/update the cache :-)

This can be a big win, if the prediction is correct it means that the jump instruction is basically free and will take zero cycles. On the other hand if the prediction is wrong, then it means the processor pipeline needs to be flushed and it can cost several cycles. So long as the prediction is correct most of the time, this will tend to be good for performance.

Like all such performance optimisations you should only do it after extensive profiling to ensure the code really is in a bottleneck, and probably given the micro nature, that it is being run in a tight loop. Generally the Linux developers are pretty experienced so I would imagine they would have done that. They don't really care too much about portability as they only target gcc, and they have a very close idea of the assembly they want it to generate.

If you are showing an error to the end user, the user is supposed to be able to act about it. In ""The list of customer names your requested could not be displayed."" case, your user will just think ""so what?"" On all of these cases, just display a ""something bad happened"" message. You do not even need to catch these exceptions, when something goes bad, let some global method (like application_error) handle it and display a generic message. When you or your user can do something about the error, catch it and do the thing or notify the user.

But you will want to log every error that you do not handle.

By the way, displaying information about the errors occuring may yield to security vulnerabilities. The less the attackers know about your system, the less likely they will find ways to hack it (remember those messages like ""Syntax error in sql statement: Select * From Users Where username='a'; drp database;--'..."" expected: 'drop' instead of 'drp'.

For simplicity, I would recommend using an iterator object or closure rather than trying to have a lazily evaluated array.  While you can use a tie to have a lazily evaluated infinite list, you can run into troubles if you ever ask (directly or indirectly, as in the foreach above) for the entire list (or even the size of the entire list).

Without writing a full class or using any modules, you can make a simple iterator factory just by using closures:

sub make_iterator {
    my ($value, $max, $step) = @_;

    return sub {
        return if $value > $max;    # Return undef when we overflow max.

        my $current = $value;
        $value += $step;            # Increment value for next call.
        return $current;            # Return current iterator value.
    };
}


And then to use it:

# All the even numbers between 0 -  100.
my $evens = make_iterator(0, 100, 2);

while (defined( my $x = $evens->() ) ) {
    print ""$x\n"";
}


There's also the Tie::Array::Lazy module on the CPAN, which provides a much richer and fuller interface to lazy arrays.  I've not used the module myself, so your mileage may vary.

All the best,

How To: Create a Service Account for an ASP.NET 2.0 Application

*This How To shows you how to create and configure a custom least-privileged service account to run an ASP.NET Web application. By default, an ASP.NET application on Microsoft Windows Server 2003 and IIS 6.0 runs using the built-in Network Service account. In production environments, you usually run your application using a custom service account. By using a custom service account, you can audit and authorize your application separately from others, and your application is protected from any changes made to the privileges or permissions associated with the Network Service account. To use a custom service account, you must configure the account by running the Aspnet_regiis.exe utility with the -ga switch, and then configure your application to run in a custom application pool that uses the custom account's identity.*

Going the polymorphic route (having to figure out which table your foreign key points to based on the contents of another field) is going to be a pain. Coding the constraints for that maybe tough (I'm not sure most databases would support that natively, I think you'd have to use a trigger).

Do items ever move between the tables? Sticking with two tables with identical definitions where one is for returns and one is for shipping may be the easiest route. If you want to stick with the definition you first proposed (with the two separate fields) is perfectly reasonable. 

""Premature optimization is the root of all evil"" and all that. While it seems wasteful, remember what you're storing. Since they are IDs they are probably just integers, maybe 4 bytes. Wasting four bytes per record is basically nothing. In fact, due to padding to put things on even addresses or other such things it may be ""free"" to put that extra field in there. It all depends on the DB design.

Unless you have a very good reason to go the polymorphic route (like you're on an embedded system with little memory or you have to replicate across some really slow 9600bps link) it probably won't be worth the headaches you can end up with. Having to write all those special cases into your queries can get annoying.

5914,113843,14065.0,2008-09-22T08:45:47Z,113830,38,"Short Answer: No.

Long Answer:
It is not the base class or the number of ancestors a class has in its hierarchy that affects it speed. The only thing is the cost of a method call.

A non virtual method call has a cost (but can be inlined)
A virtual method call has a slightly higher cost as you need to look up the method to call before you call it (but this is a simple table look up not a search). Since all methods on an interface are virtual by definition there is this cost.

Unless you are writing some hyper speed sensitive application this should not be a problem. The extra clarity that you will recieve from using an interface usually makes up for any perceived speed decrease.

Span to any hostââ-Hâ

The â-Hâ option turns on host spanning, thus allowing Wget's recursive run to visit any host referenced by a link. Unless sufficient recursion-limiting criteria are applied depth, these foreign hosts will typically link to yet more hosts, and so on until Wget ends up sucking up much more data than you have intended. 

Limit spanning to certain domainsââ-Dâ

The â-Dâ option allows you to specify the domains that will be followed, thus limiting the recursion only to the hosts that belong to these domains. Obviously, this makes sense only in conjunction with â-Hâ. 

A typical example would be downloading the contents of âwww.server.comâ, but allowing downloads from âimages.server.comâ, etc.:

      wget -rH -Dserver.com http://www.server.com/

Yes it is, and it also affects Flash in general. Until you can take advantage of the Loader.unloadAndStop() method in FP10 (AIR 1.5), you can't guarantee that externally loaded content will not continue to consume memory and cpu resources, even if you use the Loader.unload() method. (To be honest, I'm not 100% sure that even that will guarantee freeing of resources, but maybe I'm a pessimist.)

The next best thing is for you to insist that the creators of the content you load adhere to a set of guidelines, including exposing something like a dispose() method which your app can call to ask it to release as many resources as possible before you unload() it. If this isn't possible, then your application will almost definitely bloat in memory and cpu usage each time you load an external swf. Sorry. 

If it makes you feel any better, you're not alone. ;)

Your first two options don't solve anything that has shared COM components.  If you don't have any shared components issue, maybe they will work.

There is no reason the developers couldn't take a copy of the same VM to be able to debug in a clean environment.  Your issues would be more complex if there are a lot of physical layers in your architecture, like mail server, database server, etc.

But on the last project I had to do this on, I went with something much more simple, I ended up writing a couple of System.Exception derivatives for logic_error and runtime_error.

If you do huge amounts of refactoring near release you'll end up hurting yourself because you'll introduce painful merges at a time when changes should be minimized. The more disruptive your refactoring will be the earlier in the development cycle it should happen (and the more special process there should be for it, e.g. stop edits to the affected files as much as possible for a period of time).

Constantly merging to and from trunk is generally good practice.

Why work in a branch at all in that case? Because you have more control (you can stop merging into trunk to stabilize it for release, for example, without stopping checkins to your development branch). Because you can place a high level of validation around merging to/from trunk without impacting checkin velocity to the development branch much.

Inherit from the SqlServerCeDriver with a new one, and override the InitializeParamter method:

using System.Data;
using System.Data.SqlServerCe;
using NHibernate.Driver;
using NHibernate.SqlTypes;

namespace MySqlServerCeDriverNamespace
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Overridden Nhibernate SQL CE Driver,
    /// so that ntext fields are not truncated at 4000 characters
    /// </summary>
    public class MySqlServerCeDriver : SqlServerCeDriver

        protected override void InitializeParameter(
            IDbDataParameter dbParam,
            string name,
            SqlType sqlType)
        {
            base.InitializeParameter(dbParam, name, sqlType);

            if (sqlType is StringClobSqlType)
            {
                var parameter = (SqlCeParameter)dbParam;
                parameter.SqlDbType = SqlDbType.NText;
            }

        }
    }
}


Then, use this driver instead of NHibernate's in your app.config

<nhibernateDriver>MySqlServerCeDriverNamespace.MySqlServerCeDriver , MySqlServerCeDriverNamespace</nhibernateDriver>


I saw a lot of other posts where people had this problem, and solved it by just changing the sql-type attribute to ""StringClob"" - as attempted in this thread.

I'm not sure why it wouldn't work for me, but I suspect it is the fact that I'm using SQL CE and not some other DB. But, there you have it!

Do not create and throw new exceptions just to have your team's exception.


There is no hard and fast rule: but if you have a scenario for treating this exception differently, consider creating a custom exception type, such as DataNotFoundException as suggested by Johan Buret.

Go to Properties (for the Project) -> Java Build Path -> Libraries

Select the Library you want to attach source/javadoc for and then expand it, you'll see a list like so:

(I assume you know how to configure the Zabbix server to receive this data, it's pretty straightforward - just create a new item, bind it to a template and connect a template to a server or server group).

If you want to monitor some file for a specific string, just use grep, sed, cut, tr and other standard Unix tools. If you need more complex things, just write a shell script.

Your thought about storing previous searches seems reasonable to me.  I'd be curious to see how it works in practice (I mean that in the most sincere way -- there are many nuances that can cause these techniques to fail in the ""real world"", particularly when data is sparse).  

Here are some techniques I've used in the past, and seen in the literature:


Thesaurus based approaches:  Index into a thesaurus for each term that the user has used, and then use some heuristic to filter the synonyms to show the user as possible search terms.
Stem and search on that: Stem the search terms (eg: with the Porter Stemming Algorithm and then use the stemmed terms instead of the initially provided queries, and given the user the option of searching for exactly the terms they specified (or do the opposite, search the exact terms first, and use stemming to find the terms that stem to the same root.  This second approach obviously takes some pre-processing of a known dictionary, or you can collect terms as your indexing term finds them.)
Chaining: Parse the results found by the user's query and extract key terms from the top N results (KEA is one library/algorithm that you can look at for keyword extraction techniques.)

6488,125572,19317.0,2008-09-24T05:32:30Z,124210,54,"Definitely a good list.  Here are a few thoughts on it:


  Write the test first, then the code.


I agree, at a high level. But, I'd be more specific: ""Write a test first, then write just enough code to pass the test, and repeat."" Otherwise, I'd be afraid that my unit tests would look more like integration or acceptance tests.


  Design classes using dependency injection.


Agreed. When an object creates its own dependencies, you have no control over them. Inversion of Control / Dependency Injection gives you that control, allowing you to isolate the object under test with mocks/stubs/etc. This is how you test objects in isolation.


  Separate UI code from its behavior using Model-View-Controller or Model-View-Presenter.


Agreed. Note that even the presenter/controller can be tested using DI/IoC, by handing it a stubbed/mocked view and model. Check out Presenter First TDD for more on that.


  Do not write static methods or classes.


Not sure I agree with this one. It is possible to unit test a static method/class without using mocks. So, perhaps this is one of those Rhino Mock specific rules you mentioned.


  Program off interfaces, not classes. 


I agree, but for a slightly different reason. Interfaces provide a great deal of flexibility to the software developer - beyond just support for various mock object frameworks. For example, it is not possible to support DI properly without interfaces. 


  Isolate external dependencies. 


Agreed. Hide external dependencies behind your own facade or adapter (as appropriate) with an interface. This will allow you to isolate your software from the external dependency, be it a web service, a queue, a database or something else. This is especially important when your team doesn't control the dependency (a.k.a. external).


  Mark as virtual the methods you intend to mock. 


That's a limitation of Rhino Mocks. In an environment that prefers hand coded stubs over a mock object framework, that wouldn't be necessary.

And, a couple of new points to consider:

Use creational design patterns. This will assist with DI, but it also allows you to isolate that code and test it independently of other logic.

Write tests using Bill Wake's Arrange/Act/Assert technique. This technique makes it very clear what configuration is necessary, what is actually being tested, and what is expected.

Don't be afraid to roll your own mocks/stubs. Often, you'll find that using mock object frameworks makes your tests incredibly hard to read. By rolling your own, you'll have complete control over your mocks/stubs, and you'll be able to keep your tests readable. (Refer back to previous point.)

Avoid the temptation to refactor duplication out of your unit tests into abstract base classes, or setup/teardown methods. Doing so hides configuration/clean-up code from the developer trying to grok the unit test. In this case, the clarity of each individual test is more important than refactoring out duplication.

Implement Continuous Integration. Check-in your code on every ""green bar."" Build your software and run your full suite of unit tests on every check-in. (Sure, this isn't a coding practice, per se; but it is an incredible tool for keeping your software clean and fully integrated.)

The problem is that you end up in situations where load balancing can throw users back and forth between different versions of the application while you are transitioning.

The solutions we came up with (before finding SeeSaw, which we don't use) was to take half of the mongrels off line from the load balancer. Shut them down. Update them. Start them up. Put those mongrels back online in the load balancer and take the other half off. Shut the second half down. Update the second half. Start them up. This greatly minimizes the time where you have two different versions of the application running simultaneously. 
I wrote a windows bat file to do this. (Deploying on Windows is not recommended, btw)

It is very important to note that having database migrations can make the whole approach a little dangerous. If you have only additive migrations, you can run those at any time before the deployment.  If you are removing columns, you need to do it after the deployment. If you are renaming columns, it is better to split it into a create a new column and copy data into it migration to run before deployment and a separate script to remove the old column after deployment.  In fact, it may be dangerous to use your regular migrations on a production database in general if you don't make a specific effort to organize them.  All of this points to making more frequent deliveries so each update is lower risk and less complex, but that's a subject for another response.

You may not need many of the features, but you can access the API for what it provides you. Your WinForms screens can simply use the Urls for identification so that you can determine your place in the hierarchy.

What you may have to do is create a custom implementation of the provider because it will use the HttpContext to get the Url of the current web request to identify current placement while you will need to get that value differently. That is what could be tricky because your WinForm application could be displaying multiple windows at time. If you know there is only one window showing at a time you could use a static value which is set prior to accessing the SiteMap API.

Now you have to question the value of using an API if you have to do all of the work. There may not be enough benefit to make it worthwhile.

6479,125337,11830.0,2008-09-24T03:53:47Z,125050,36,"Polymorphism is the facility that allows a language/program to make decisions during runtime on which method to invoke based on the types of the parameters sent to that method. 

The number of parameters used by the language/runtime determines the 'type' of polymorphism supported by a language. 

Single dispatch is a type of polymorphism where only one parameter is used (the receiver of the message - this, or self) to determine the call.

Multiple dispatch is a type of polymorphism where in multiple parameters are used in determining which method to call. In this case, the reciever as well as the types of the method parameters are used to tell which method to invoke.

So you can say that polymorphism is the general term and multiple and single dispatch are specific types of polymorphism.

Addendum: Overloading happens during compile time. It uses the type information available during compilation to determine which type of method to call. Single/multiple dispatch happens during runtime.

Which blog receives a post is determined by user credentials, which works fine as long as only one node type is available for access through BlogAPI, but when you try and have two or more node types available through the module, things tend to fall apart.

Looking at the state of BlogAPI in Drupal's HEAD on CVS, we might not see a solution to this until 8.x at the earliest. However, there are several people working on redeveloping BlogAPI as a third party module, perhaps to merge back in to Drupal core at some later date.

The direction of the arrow connectors on the class diagram just specifies the who knows who. That means, the dependencies between classes. With those arrows you can communicate which classes need what other classes, but you don't have to explain there how are the dynamics of the collaboration between those clases. That's what UML dynamic diagrams are for.

Start with your class diagram, which is the static view of the system, and then add some dynamic diagrams.

As dynamic diagrams, together with sequence diagrams that are the most common, you can also use:


Activity diagrams
State diagrams
Collaboration diagrams


Each has its own point of interest, and the main strategy is that you reuse some of the objects defined in your class diagram in order to describe specific scenarios.

For each one of the 'interesting' scenarios on your system, you should make one of these dynamic diagrams to describe what happens between the objects that you specified on your class diagram.

Typically, each use case will be described by one class diagram and one or more dynamic diagrams. All these design information together is called the use case realization, because they describe the design that will make your use case real when the code is built.

So the only recommendation I could make is to start small, to get the hang of it.  Deploying one simple application first.  Trying to deploy a complete product that is already made without experience with JWS gets complicated rather quickly.

Also, learning how to pass arguments to the JWS application was invaluable for debugging.  Setting the Environment variable JAVAWS_VM_ARGS allows setting any arbitrary property to the Java Virtual machine.  In my case:

-Xdebug -Xnoagent -Xrunjdwp:transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=4144

Helpful when you need to check problems during start-up (suspend=y)

I think the main problem for the acceptance of Java Web Start is that it is relatively difficult to setup.  Also, somehow there is this dissonance:  When you have a desktop application, people expects a installer they can double click.  When you have a web application, people expects they can use it right from the browser.  Java Web Start is neither here not there...

It is widely used in intranets, though.

# SELECT * FROM test;
 a | b | c

Now for the tricky bit, you need to connect to your database using the postgres user so you can modify the system tables.

    27666 | cmin     |     -4
    27666 | xmin     |     -3
    27666 | ctid     |     -1

    27666 | a        |      2
    27666 | c        |      3
(9 rows)


attnum is a unique column, so you need to use a temporary value when you're modifying the column numbers as such:


# UPDATE pg_attribute SET attnum=4 WHERE attname='a' AND attrelid=27666;
UPDATE 1
# UPDATE pg_attribute SET attnum=1 WHERE attname='b' AND attrelid=27666;
UPDATE 1
# UPDATE pg_attribute SET attnum=2 WHERE attname='a' AND attrelid=27666;
UPDATE 1

# SELECT * FROM test;
 b | a | c 
---+---+---
 1 | 2 | 3

In the game, your program asks the user for a guess. A correct guess is a winner. Otherwise, the user tries again. The game continues until the user guesses correctly, so we write that:

main = untilM (isCorrect 42) (read `liftM` getLine)


This uses a combinator that repeatedly runs an action (getLine pulls a line of input and read converts that string to an integer in this case) and checks its result:

untilM :: Monad m => (a -> m Bool) -> m a -> m ()
untilM p a = do
  x <- a
  done <- p x
  if done
    then return ()
    else untilM p a


The predicate (partially applied in main) checks the guess against the correct value and responds accordingly:

isCorrect :: Int -> Int -> IO Bool
isCorrect num guess =
  case compare num guess of
    EQ -> putStrLn ""You Win!""  >> return True
    LT -> putStrLn ""Too high!"" >> return False
    GT -> putStrLn ""Too low!""  >> return False


The action to be run until the player guesses correctly is

read `liftM` getLine


Why not keep it simple and just compose the two functions?

*Main> :type read . getLine

<interactive>:1:7:
    Couldn't match expected type `a -> String'
           against inferred type `IO String'
    In the second argument of `(.)', namely `getLine'
    In the expression: read . getLine

The type of getLine is IO String, but read wants a pure String.

The function liftM from Control.Monad takes a pure function and âliftsâ it into a monad. The type of the expression tells us a great deal about what it does:

*Main> :type read `liftM` getLine
read `liftM` getLine :: (Read a) => IO a

It's an I/O action that when run gives us back a value converted with read, an Int in our case. Recall that readLine is an I/O action that yields String values, so you can think of liftM as allowing us to apply read âinsideâ the IO monad.

Sample game:

1
Too low!
100
Too high!
42
You Win!

That's the only difference.  So asking whether you can extend a struct is no different than asking if you can extend a class.

There is one caveat here.  There is no guarantee of layout consistency from compiler to compiler.  So if you compile your C code with a different compiler than your C++ code, you may run into problems related to member layout (padding especially).  This can even occur when using C and C++ compilers from the same vendor.

I have had this happen with gcc and g++.  I worked on a project which used several large structs.  Unfortunately, g++ packed the structs significantly looser than gcc, which caused significant problems sharing objects between C and C++ code.  We eventually had to manually set packing and insert padding to make the C and C++ code treat the structs the same.  Note however, that this problem can occur regardless of subclassing.  In fact we weren't subclassing the C struct in this case.

When you run an EXPLAIN on a query, it tells you everything MySQL knows about that query in the form of reports for each table involved in the query.

Each of these reports will tell you...


the ID of the table (in the query)
the table's role in a larger selection (if applicable, might just say SIMPLE if it's only one table)
the name of the table (duh)
the join type (if applicable, defaults to const)
a list of indexes on the table (or NULL if none), *possible_keys*
the name of the index that MySQL decided to use, key
the size of the key value (in bytes)
ref shows the cols or values used to match against the key
rows is the number of rows that MySQL thinks it needs to examine in order to satisfy the query. This should be kept as close to your calculated minimum as possible!
...then any extra information MySQL wishes to convey

If the code is really a set of utilities that doesn't need access to object state, I would consider putting it in a module to be called separately.  For instance, if the code is all mapping utilities, create a module Maps, and access the methods like:  Maps::driving_directions.
If the code needs state and is used or could be used in every controller, put the code in ApplicationController.
If the code needs state and is used in a subset of all controllers that are closely and logically related (i.e. all about maps) then create a base class (class MapController < ApplicationController) and put the shared code there.
If the code needs state and is used in a subset of all controllers that are not very closely related, put it in a module and include it in necessary controllers.


In your case, the methods need state (params), so the choice depends on the logical relationship between the controllers that need it.
In addition:

Also:


Use partials when possible for repeated code and either place in a common 'partials' directory or include via a specific path.
Stick to a RESTful approach when possible (for methods) and if you find yourself creating a lot of non-RESTful methods consider extracting them to their own controller.

Assert liberally. You can never have too many assertions.
Assertions don't replace exceptions. Exceptions cover the things your code demands; assertions cover the things it assumes.
A well-written assertion can tell you not just what happened and where (like an exception), but why.
An exception message can often be cryptic, requiring you to work backwards through the code to recreate the context that caused the error. An assertion can preserve the program's state at the time the error occurred.
Assertions double as documentation, telling other developers what implied assumptions your code depends on.
The dialog that appears when an assertion fails lets you attach a debugger to the process, so you can poke around the stack as if you had put a breakpoint there.


PS: If you liked Code Complete, I recommend following it up with this book. I bought it to learn about using WinDBG and dump files, but the first half is packed with tips to help avoid bugs in the first place.

Anyway, it's quite simple.
Just write a class with static fields for your secret key and so on, and static methods to encrypt, decrypt your passwords.
Encrypt your password in Tomcat's configuration file (server.xml or yourapp.xml...) using this class.

And to decrypt the password ""on the fly"" in Tomcat, extend the DBCP's BasicDataSourceFactory and use this factory in your resource.

It will look like:

    <Resource
        name=""jdbc/myDataSource""
        auth=""Container""
        type=""javax.sql.DataSource""
        username=""user""

        driverClassName=""driverClass""
        factory=""mypackage.MyCustomBasicDataSourceFactory""
        url=""jdbc:blabla://...""/>


And for the custom factory:

package mypackage;

....

public class MyCustomBasicDataSourceFactory extends org.apache.tomcat.dbcp.dbcp.BasicDataSourceFactory {

@Override
public Object getObjectInstance(Object obj, Name name, Context nameCtx, Hashtable environment) throws Exception {
    Object o = super.getObjectInstance(obj, name, nameCtx, environment);
    if (o != null) {
        BasicDataSource ds = (BasicDataSource) o;
        if (ds.getPassword() != null && ds.getPassword().length() > 0) {
            String pwd = MyPasswordUtilClass.unscramblePassword(ds.getPassword());

Perl has built in functions for using the array as a stack or list : push/pop, shift/unshift, splice (inserting or removing in the middle) and the foreach form for iteration.

Perl also has a map, called a hashmap which is the equivalent to a Dictionary in Python - allowing you to have an association between a single key and a single value.

Perl developers often compose these two data-structures to build what they need - need multiple values?  Store array-references in the value part of the hashtable (Map).  Trees can be built in a similar manner - if you need unique keys, use multiple-levels of hashmaps, or if you don't use nested array references.

These two primitive collection types in Perl don't have an Object Oriented api, but they still are collections.

If you look on CPAN you'll likely find modules that provide other Object Oriented data structures, it really depends on your need.  Is there a particular data structure you need besides a List, Stack or Map?  You might get a more precise answer (eg a specific module) if you're asking about a particular data structure.

Forgot to mention, if you're looking for small code examples across a variety of languages, PLEAC (Programming Language Examples Alike Cookbook) is a decent resource.

Don't do that!  =)  Your simple unit test has now become an integration test because it depends on the successful operation of more than one class.  Write a class that handles configuration values.  WebConfigSettingsReader could be the name, and it should encapsulate the ConfigurationManager.AppSettings call.  Pass an instance of that SettingsReader class into the constructor of Class2Test.  Then, in your unit test, you can mock your WebConfigSettingsReader and stub out a response to any calls you might make to it.

Data visualization is a HUGE area of study and it's not significantly different for web applications versus desktop applications. 

Put simply, it's the display of data in a way that visually tells the story of the data. It's most useful in cases where the volume of data is such that tabular display isn't effective. Trends, outliers, and abnormal occurrences can sometimes only be seen when data is represented visually. Visually can be a simple chart, or it can be more advanced visualizations such as treemaps or thematic mapping/GIS presentations.

If it's an area you're interested in studying, look into:

Edward Tufte - Author, professor, and all-around guru for the display of information

Many Eyes - from IBM AlphaWorks

Processing - A visual ""sketching"" language based on Java

Visualizing Data - An O'Reilly book by Ben Fry, one of the co-creators of Processing

Beyond that, I think specifics would depend on what you want to accomplish -- what data is being analyzed, who the audience is, and what the desired ""message"" is.

In many scenarios especially where your container exists for the lifetime of the hosting application, and where transient components really don't need to be tracked (because you're handling disposal in your calling code or component that's been injected with the service) then you can just set the release policy to the NoTrackingReleasePolicy implementation and be done with it.

If anyone else (running Windows) has already synced the wrong-cased version, then when they sync again the right one, it will not change the case on their PC. This is a peculiarity of the Windows file system acknowledging case but still being fundamentally case-independent.

If a number of users have synced, and it is not convenient to get them to remove-from-client too (and blasting the folders from their machines), then you can resort to a dark and dirty Perforce technique called ""Checkpoint surgery"". It's not for the fainthearted, but you do this:


Stop your server, take a checkpoint.
Using your favourite text editor that can handle multi-megabyte files, search & replace all occurances of the old case name with the new. You could of course use a script too.
Replay your checkpoint file to recreate the Perforce database meta data.
Restart your server.


This will affect all user client specs transparently, and so when they sync they will get the right case as if by magic.

It sounds hairy, but I've had to do it before and as long as you take care, backup, do a trial run etc, then all should be OK.

I don't think Tunnelier supports Xwindows tunneling.  Take a look at Xming, an Xwindows server for Windows that comes with Putty, an ssh client:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming

edit: Glad to see this worked for you.  Here's some more explanation on what's happening.  X-Windows, the Unix graphical environment is client-server based.  IE: it's able to display individual graphical windows on remote systems without full-screen software like VNC or remote desktop.  A graphical program in Unix is called the X-Windows client, and the thing that actually does the displaying is called an X-Windows server.

Now, Bitvise Tunnelier is just an ssh client.  IE: it only deals with command-line terminal connections.  However, the ssh protocol is actually able to tunnel X-Windows over ssh, but you need two things: 1) an X-Windows server running on your desktop (to actually display the app), and 2) an ssh client that supports X-Windows tunneling.  Enter Xming, a lightweight X server for windows, and Putty, the ssh client.

So, you were fine ssh-ing in to your Sun box, and typing terminal commands, but Visual SlickEdit is an X-Windows client app.  To run that, you needed an X-Windows server.  When an X-Windows server is available, it sets the DISPLAY variable on the terminal to tell graphical apps where to display stuff.

One more note:  Some of the answers below recommended that you set the DISPLAY variable to the hostname of your Sun box.  That might have worked, but it would have displayed the VS windows on the Sun's screen, not your Windows box.

Create the graph as in your question, but using the new class

ListenableDirectedWeightedGraph g =

Override the method setEdgeWeight as follows:

public void setEdgeWeight(E e, double weight) {

    ((MyWeightedEdge)e).setWeight(weight);

And, last but not least, override the toString method of the class MyWeightedEdge to return the label you want the edge to have (presumably including the weight, which is now available to it).

To get the keys of a hash, I recommend adding this to your init.m or your personal utilities library:

keys[f_] := DownValues[f][[All,1,1,1]]  (* Keys of a hash/dictionary. *)


(Or the following pure function version is supposedly slightly faster:

keys = DownValues[#][[All,1,1,1]]&;     (* Keys of a hash/dictionary. *)


)

Either way, keys[a] now returns what you want.  (You can get the values of the hash with a /@ keys[a].)  If you want to allow for higher arity hashes, like a[1,2]=5; a[3,4]=6 then you can use this:

SetAttributes[removeHead, {HoldAll}];
removeHead[h_[args___]] := {args}
keys[f_] := removeHead @@@ DownValues[f][[All,1]]


Which returns {{1,2}, {3,4}}.  (In that case you can get the hash values with a @@@ keys[a].)

Note that DownValues by default sorts the keys, which is probably not a good idea since at best it takes extra time. If you want the keys sorted you can just do Sort@keys[f].  So I would actually recommend this version:

keys = DownValues[#,Sort->False][[All,1,1,1]]&;


Interestingly, there is no mention of the Sort option in the DownValues documention.  I found out about it from an old post from Daniel Lichtblau of Wolfram Research.  (I confirmed that it still works in the current version (7.0) of Mathematica.)


Footnotes:

[1] What's really handy is that you can mix and match that with function definitions.  Like:

fib[0] = 1;
fib[1] = 1;
fib[n_] := fib[n-1] + fib[n-2]


You can then add memoization by changing that last line to

fib[n_] := fib[n] = fib[n-1] + fib[n-2]

In a nutshell, using const is good practice because...


It protects you from accidentally changing variables that aren't intended be changed, 
It protects you from making accidental variable assignments, and 
The compiler can optimize it.  For instance, you are protected from

if( x = y ) // whoops, meant if( x == y )



At the same time, the compiler can generate more efficient code because it knows exactly what the state of the variable/function will be at all times.  If you are writing tight C++ code, this is good.

You are correct in that it can be difficult to use const-correctness consistently, but the end code is more concise and safer to program with.  When you do a lot of C++ development, the benefits of this quickly manifest.

No.

A malicious machine on your network could use ARP spoofing (or a number of other techniques) to intercept your pings and reply to them after certain periods. They would then not only know what your random numbers are, they would control them.

Of course there's still the question of how deterministic your local network is, so it might not be as easy as all that in practice. But since you get no benefit from pinging random IPs on the internet, you might just as well draw entropy from ethernet traffic. 

Drawing entropy from devices attached to your machine is a well-studied principle, and the pros and cons of various kinds of devices and methods of measuring can be e.g. stolen from the implementation of /dev/random.

[Edit: as a general principle, when working in the fundamentals of security (and the only practical needs for significant quantities of truly random data are security-related) you MUST assume that a fantastically well-resourced, determined attacker will do everything in their power to break your system.

For practical security, you can assume that nobody wants your PGP key that badly, and settle for a trade-off of security against cost. But when inventing algorithms and techniques, you need to give them the strongest security guarantees that they could ever possibly face. Since I can believe that someone, somewhere, might want someone else's private key badly enough do build this bit of kit to defeat your proposal, I can't accept it as an advance over current best practice. AFAIK /dev/random follows fairly close to best practice for generating truly random data on a cheap home PC]

[Another edit: it has suggested in comments that (1) it is true of any TRNG that the physical process could be influenced, and (2) that security concerns don't apply here anyway.

The answer to (1) is that it's possible on any realistic hardware to do so much better than ping response times, and gather more entropy faster, that this proposal is a non-solution. In CS terms, obviously you can't generate random numbers on a deterministic machine, which is what provoked the question. But then in CS terms a machine with any external input stream is non-deterministic by definition, so if we're talking about ping then we aren't talking about deterministic machines. So it makes sense to look at the real inputs that real machines have, and consider them as sources of randomness. No matter what your machine, raw ping times are not high on the list of sources available, so they can be ruled out before worrying about good the better ones are. Assuming that a network is not subverted is a much bigger (and unnecessary) assumption than assuming that your own hardware is not subverted.

The answer to (2) is philosophical. If you don't mind your random numbers having the property that they can be chosen at whim instead of by chance, then this proposal is OK. But that's not what I understand by the term 'random'. Just because something is inconsistent doesn't mean it's necessarily random.

Finally, to address the implementation details of the proposal as requested: assuming you accept ping times as random, you still can't use the unprocessed ping times as RNG output. You don't know their probability distribution, and they certainly aren't uniformly distributed (which is normally what people want from an RNG). 

So, you need to decide how many bits of entropy per ping you are willing to rely on. Entropy is a precisely-defined mathematical property of a random variable which can reasonably be considered a measure of how 'random' it actually is. In practice, you find a lower bound you're happy with. Then hash together a number of inputs, and convert that into a number of bits of output less than or equal to the total relied-upon entropy of the inputs. 'Total' doesn't necessarily mean sum: if the inputs are statistically independent then it is the sum, but this is unlikely to be the case for pings, so part of your entropy estimate will be to account for correlation. The sophisticated big sister of this hashing operation is called an 'entropy collector', and all good OSes have one.

If you're using the data to seed a PRNG, though, and the PRNG can use arbitrarily large seed input, then you don't have to hash because it will do that for you. You still have to estimate entropy if you want to know how 'random' your seed value was - you can use the best PRNG in the world, but its entropy is still limited by the entropy of the seed.]

The first suggestion I have would be to use the HttpListener class (and possibly Webclient or other System.Net http related classes to re-post the requests to your application) as a proxy for the WebBrowser test calls.  I have no experience with HttpListener, but it looks like a simple and promising way to proxy calls through to your app.

The second suggestion I have is to do what Fiddler does: tap into the WinINET Http stack on your test machine to act as a proxy (with some sort of filter to narrow it down to JUST your WebBrowser's calls).  Unforunately, the best example of this I have been able to find is Fiddler itself and the only way I know to get the code is Reflector.  It might be possible to get to the Fiddler proxy code another way, but I did not have time to investigate this path fully.

I/O threads are set aside as such because they will be doing I/O (as the name implies) and may have to wait for ""long"" periods of time (hundreds of milliseconds).  They also can be optimized and used differently to take advantage of I/O completion port functionality in the Windows kernel.  A single I/O thread may be managing multiple completion ports to maintain throughput.

Windows has a lot of capabilities for dealing with I/O blocking whereas ASP.NET/.NET has a plain concept of ""Thread"".  ASP.NET can optimize for I/O by using more of the unmanaged threading capabilities in the OS. You wouldn't want to do this all the time for every thread as you lose a lot of capabilities that .NET gives you which is why there is a distinction between how the threads are intended to be used.

Worker threads are threads upon which regular ""work"" or just plain code/processing happens.  Worker threads are unlikely to block a lot or wait on anything and will be short running and therefore require more aggressive scheduling to maximize processing power and throughput.

Is that actually your code, or is that how you've represented the problem for us to understand? Is the text for the SQL stored in your DFM or populated dynamically? 

I was wondering if perhaps somehow the Params property of the query had already got a list of parameters defined/cached, in the IDE, and that might explain why P1 was being seen as output (which is almost certainly causing your NULL problem).

Just before you set the ParamByName.Value, try


ParamByName(""Foo"").ParamType=ptInput;


I'm not sure why you changing the connection string would also fix this, unless it's resetting the internal sense of the parameters for that query.

Under TSQLQuery, the Params property of a query gets reset/recreated whenever the SQL.Text value is changed (I'm not sure if that's true for a TADOQuery mind you), so that first snippet of yours ought to have caused any existing Params information to have been dropped.

If the 'ParamByname.ParamType' suggestion above does fix it for you, then surely there's something happening to the query elsewhere (at create-time? on the form?) that is causing it to think Foo is an output parameter...

does that help at all? :-)

However, this doesn't

Items.mine.find_by_sql 'select * from items limit 1'

So the answer is ""No"". If you think about what has to happen behind the scenes then this makes a lot of sense. In order to build the SQL rails has to know how it fits together.
When you create normal queries, the select, joins, conditions, etc are all broken up into distinct pieces. Rails knows that it can add things to the conditions without affecting everything else (which is how with_scope and named_scope work).

With find_by_sql however, you just give rails a big string. It doesn't know what goes where, so it's not safe for it to go in and add the things it would need to add for the scopes to work.

If the service crashes it doesn't restart by default (although you can change this in service properties)
IIS will recycle the application pool if it hangs or grows too big; you must do this yourself if you want the same sort of reliability.
You must create an account for the service to run under, or use one of the default services. Resit the temptation to run the service as SYSTEM or under an administrator account; if you want to use a built in account use NETWORK SERVICE.

The easiest way to do what you want is via the load() method on the Image object which returns a pixel access object which you can manipulate like an array:

from PIL import Image
im = Image.open(""dead_parrot.jpg"") #Can be many different formats.
pix = im.load()
print im.size #Get the width and hight of the image for iterating over
print pix[x,y] #Get the RGBA Value of the a pixel of an image
pix[x,y] = value # Set the RGBA Value of the image (tuple)


Alternatively, look at ImageDraw which gives a much richer API for creating images.

I would highly recommend to switch to SVN or git instead.  And that you do this conversion as soon as possible... like today :)

There are even svn tools/guides and git tools/guides out there that will do this CVS conversion for you.

I personally use and love SVN for my work, but based on your above description, it sounds like git might be the better option for you.

We just write everything out to the registry and then have a separate component that takes over the system-wide default and is only installed if no other application has already registered itself as the default.

With Vista there's the new ""default programs"" interface, again you write everything out to the registry. Here's a complete example that we're using in our installer. (WiX 3.0)

Update: 12 months have passed since my original answer and I have a better understanding of file associations. Rather than writing everything manually I'm now using proper ProgId definitions which improves handling for advertised packages. See the updated code posted in response to this question.

ini_set(""session.entropy_file"", ""/dev/urandom"");
ini_set(""session.entropy_length"", ""512"");


search for ""php_session_create_id"" in the code for the actual algorithm they're using.

Edited to add: 
There's a DFA random-number generator seeded by the pid, mixed with the time in usecs.  It's not a firm uniqueness condition especially from a security perspective.  Use the entropy config above.

Update: 


  As of PHP 5.4.0 session.entropy_file defaults to /dev/urandom or

You just have to make sure that the vim distribution you are using has been compiled with python support.

If you are using a Linux system, you can download the source and then compile it with

./configure --enable-pythoninterp 
make
sudo make install


Inside vim, you can type

:version


to list the available features; if it has python support, you should see a '+python' somewhere (a '-python' otherwise).

Then, to check the usage of the python module, you can type

:help python


P.S: if you're going to compile the vim sources, make sure to check the available configure options, you might need to specify --with-python-config-dir as well.

P.P.S: to create a ""custom command in command mode"" (if I understand correctly what you mean), you can create a function ""MyFunction"" in a vim script (using python or the vim scripting language) and then invoke it with 

:Call MyFunction()

In my experience, the total effort required is considerably less when using Laszlo, and the class-based object model helps to keep your code better organised than when using JS frameworks. My only complaints about Laszlo were that: 


It ""breaks the browser"" in terms of support for the back/forward/refresh buttons. This problem also exists with AJAX, but most JS libraries seem to have found a workaround.
No support for internationalization, though none of the JS libraries are any better in my experience
Relatively small user base/community compared to competitors such as GWT, JQuery, etc.


All in all, I thought OpenLaszlo was a pretty good solution for creating rich web-based user interfaces, and has a number of very novel features, e.g. ability to deploy on multiple runtimes (Flash, DHTML, etc.) without requiring any code changes.

Also, I should mention that I haven't used it for almost a year, so it's likely that some progress has been made in recent times on the issues I mentioned above.

Update

5 years since I posted this answer, things have changed considerably. In case anyone is in any doubt, don't use Laszlo, the project is completely moribund.

Make sure that the StreamReader and StreamWriter objects you use all use the same encoding as the one you used with the XmlWriter (not just the StreamWriter, like someone else suggested), or
Don't use StreamReader/StreamWriter. Instead just copy the stream at the byte level using a simple byte[] and Stream.Read/Write. This is going to be, btw, a lot more efficient anyway.

7155,139633,6742.0,2008-09-26T13:53:40Z,139630,130,"Here's a list of differences. I've highlighted Oracle-specific features, and hopefully the community can add in other vendors' specific difference also. Differences that are common to most vendors can go directly below the headings, with differences highlighted below.



General Overview

If you want to quickly delete all of the rows from a table, and you're really sure that you want to do it, and you do not have foreign keys against the tables, then a TRUNCATE is probably going to be faster than a DELETE.

Various system-specific issues have to be considered, as detailed below.



Statement type

Delete is DML, Truncate is DDL



Commit and Rollback

Variable by vendor

SQL*Server

Truncate can be rolled back.

PostgreSQL

Truncate can be rolled back.

Oracle

Because a TRUNCATE is DDL it involves two commits, one before and one after the statement execution. Truncate can therefore not be rolled back, and a failure in the truncate process will have issued a commit anyway.

However, see Flashback below.



Space reclamation

Delete does not recover space, Truncate recovers space

Oracle

If you use the REUSE STORAGE clause then the data segments are not de-allocated, which can be marginally more efficient if the table is to be reloaded with data. The high water mark is reset.



Row scope

Delete can remove only some rows. Truncate removes all rows.

Oracle

When a table is partitioned, the individual partitions can be truncated in isolation, thus a partial removal of all the table's data is possible.



Object types

Delete can be applied to tables and tables inside a cluster. Truncate applies only to tables or the entire cluster. (May be Oracle specific)



Data Object Identity

Oracle

Delete does not affect the data object id, but truncate assigns a new data object id unless there has never been an insert against the table since its creation Even a single insert that is rolled back will cause a new data object id to be assigned upon truncation.



Flashback (Oracle)

Flashback works across deletes, but a truncate prevents flashback to states prior to the operation.

However, from 11gR2 the FLASHBACK ARCHIVE feature allows this, except in Express Edition

Use of FLASHBACK in Oracle
http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E11882_01/appdev.112/e41502/adfns_flashback.htm#ADFNS638



Privileges

Variable

Oracle

Delete can be granted on a table to another user or role, but truncate cannot be without using a DROP ANY TABLE grant.



Redo/Undo

Delete generates a small amount of redo and a large amount of undo. Truncate generates a negligible amount of each.



Indexes

Oracle

A truncate operation renders unusable indexes usable again. Delete does not.



Foreign Keys

A truncate cannot be applied when an enabled foreign key references the table. Treatment with delete depends on the configuration of the foreign keys.



Table Locking

Oracle

Truncate requires an exclusive table lock, delete requires a shared table lock. Hence disabling table locks is a way of preventing truncate operations on a table.



Triggers

DML triggers do not fire on a truncate.

Oracle

DDL triggers are available.



Remote Execution

Oracle

Truncate cannot be issued over a database link.



Identity Columns

SQL*Server

Truncate resets the sequence for IDENTITY column types, delete does not.

window.onbeforeunload = function(e)
{
    e = e || window.event;  
    if (formIsDirty(document.forms[""someFormOfInterest""]))
    {
        // For IE and Firefox
        if (e)
        {
            e.returnValue = ""You have unsaved changes."";
        }
        // For Safari
        return ""You have unsaved changes."";
    }
};


Wrap it all up, and what do you get?

var confirmExitIfModified = (function()
{
    function formIsDirty(form)
    {
        // ...as above
    }

    return function(form, message)
    {
        window.onbeforeunload = function(e)
        {
            e = e || window.event;
            if (formIsDirty(document.forms[form]))
            {
                // For IE and Firefox
                if (e)
                {
                    e.returnValue = message;
                }
                // For Safari
                return message;
            }
        };
    };
})();

confirmExitIfModified(""someForm"", ""You have unsaved changes."");


You'll probably also want to change the registration of the beforeunload event handler to use LIBRARY_OF_CHOICE's event registration.

Here is one possible way of achieving this. Script Task can be used to find the list of files present in an FTP folder path for a given pattern (say *.txt). Below example shows how this can be done.

Step-by-step process:


On the SSIS package, create an FTP Connection named FTP and also create 5 variables as shown in screenshot #1. Variable RemotePath contains the FTP folder path; LocalPath contains the folder where the files will be downloaed to; FilePattern contains the file pattern to find the list of files to download from FTP server; FileName will be populated by the Foreach loop container but to avoid FTP task design time error, it can be populated with / or the DelayValidation property on the FTP Task can be set to True.
On the SSIS package, place a Script Task, Foreach Loop container and FTP Task within the Foreach Loop container as shown in screenshots #2.
Replace the Main() method within the Script Task with the code under the Script Task Code section. Script Task will populate the variable ListOfFiles with the collection of files matching a given pattern. This example will first use the pattern *.txt, which yields no results and then later the pattern *.xls that will match few files on the FTP server.
Configure the Foreach Loop container as shown in screenshots #3 and #4. This task will loop through the variable *ListOfFiles. If there are no files, the FTP task inside the loop container will not execute. If there are files, the FTP task inside the loop container will execute for the task for the number of files found on the FTP server.
Configure the FTP Task as shown in screenshots #5 and #6.
Screenshot #7 shows sample package execution when no matching files are found for the pattern *.txt.
Screenshot #8 shows the contents of the folder C:\temp\ before execution of the package.
Screenshot #9 shows sample package execution when matching files are found for the pattern *.xls.
Screenshot #10 shows the contents of the FTP remote path /Practice/Directory_New.
Screenshot #11 shows the contents of the folder C:\temp\ after execution of the package.
Screenshot #12 shows the package failure when provided with incorrect Remote path.
Screenshot #13 shows the error message related to the package failure.

With that in mind, you can say that dirty reads isn't safe in any JVM... Unless you don't mind the possibility that you won't ever be able to read the updates that other threads make - an unlikely situation but it could happen.

Also, when you actually follow your link to Terracottas wiki, it says that the article has been removed and that the pattern is discouraged.

void methodName() {
  for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
    int i = j * 2;

  System.out.println(i); // error

Because 'i' doesn't exist outside the for block.

The problem is that Java doesn't allow you to create a variable with the same name of another variable that was declared in an outer block of the same method. As other people have said, supposedly this was done to prevent bugs that are hard to identify.

APPLICATION_COMPLETE should have you covered for the initial load.

7423,143611,4687.0,2008-09-27T13:02:23Z,141370,44,"Don't forget one thing : PropertyChanged event is mainly consumed by components that will use reflection to get the value of the named property.

The most obvious example is databinding.

When you fire PropertyChanged event, passing the name of the property as a parameter, you should know that the subscriber of this event is likely to use reflection by calling, for instance, GetProperty (at least the first time if it uses a cache of PropertyInfo), then GetValue. This last call is a dynamic invocation (MethodInfo.Invoke) of the property getter method, which costs more than the GetProperty which only queries meta data. (Note that data binding relies on the whole TypeDescriptor thing -- but the default implementation uses reflection.)

So, of course using hard code property names when firing PropertyChanged is more efficient than using reflection for dynamically getting the name of the property, but IMHO, it is important to balance your thoughts. In some cases, the performance overhead is not that critical, and you could benefit from some kind on strongly typed event firing mechanism.

Here is what I use sometimes in C# 3.0, when performances would not be a concern :

public class Person : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    private string name;

    public string Name
    {
        get { return this.name; }
        set 
        { 
            this.name = value;
            FirePropertyChanged(p => p.Name);
        }
    }

    private void FirePropertyChanged<TValue>(Expression<Func<Person, TValue>> propertySelector)
    {
        if (PropertyChanged == null)
            return;

        var memberExpression = propertySelector.Body as MemberExpression;
        if (memberExpression == null)
            return;

        PropertyChanged(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(memberExpression.Member.Name));
    }

    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;
}


Notice the use of the expression tree to get the name of the property, and the use of the lambda expression as an Expression :

FirePropertyChanged(p => p.Name);

7358,142667,4919.0,2008-09-27T01:02:48Z,142470,9,"I am going to briefly address each area for three popular Python frameworks. This is only based on my personal experiences and observations.

Development speed and convenience

For TurboGears, Pylons, and Django, development speed is roughly equal. Being modern frameworks, it's easy to get started on a new site and start throwing together pages. Python is famously fast to develop and debug and I would put any Python framework as having a shorter development time than any other setup I've worked with (including PHP, Perl, Embedded Perl, and C#/ASP.Net).

Barriers to entry - developer training and infrastructure

If you know Python and are willing to watch a 20 minute video tutorial, you can create a fairly complete wiki-type site from scratch. Or you can walk through a social-bookmarking site tutorial in 30 minutes (including installation). These are TurboGears examples but the other two frameworks have nearly identical tutorials as well.

The test/development infrastructure that comes out of the box with these frameworks is generally enough to complete most sites. At any point, you can swap out components to meet your production environment requirements. For example, SQLite is fine for setting up your models and loading test data, but you will want to install MySQL (for example) before going live or storing large amounts of data.

In all cases, the requirements are very low and dictated entirely by your scalability requirements and not any peculiarities of the framework. If you are comfortable with a certain template language or ORM, it will probably plug right in.

Lock-in

This is a generalized problem across all frameworks. When you select a language, you limit your code-reuse options. When you select a templater, you are again locked in (although that's easier to change, in general, than other things). The same goes for your ORM, database, and so on. There is nothing these frameworks do specifically that will help or hinder lock-in.

Flexibility

It's all about MVC with these three frameworks. As you said, that's a very different discussion!

Performance, scalability, and stability

Well, if you write good code, your site will perform well! Again, this is a problem across all frameworks addressed by different development techniques and is probably way outside the scope of this answer.

The SVN-mirror way

You can use svn mirror as explained in the SVN book documentation to create a read-only mirror of your master repository. Your developers each interact with the mirror closest to them. However users of the slave repository will have to use 

svn switch --relocate master_url

before they can commit and they will have to remember to relocate back on the slave once they are done. This could be automated using a wrapper script around the repository modifying commands on SVN if you use the command line client. Keep in mind that the relocate operation while fast adds a bit of overhead. (And be careful to duplicate the repository uuid - see the SVN documentation.)

[Edit - Checking the TortoiseSVN documentation it seems that you can have TortoiseSVN execute hook scripts client side. You may be able to create a pre/post commit script at this point. Either that or try to see if you can use the TortoiseSVN automation interface to do it].

The SVK way

svk is a set of Perl scripts which emulate a distributed mirroring service over SVN. You can set it up so that the local branch (the mirror) is shared by multiple developers. Then basic usage for the developers will be completely transparent. You will have to use the svk client for cherry picking, merging and starmerging. It is doable if you can get your head around the distributed concepts. 

The git-svn way

While I never used that myself, you could also have distant developers use git locally and use the git-svn gateway for synchronization. 

Final words

It all depends on your development environment and the level of integration you require. Depending on your IDE (and if you can change SCM) you might want to have a look at other fully distributed SCMs (think Mercurial/Bazaar/Git/...) which support distributed development out of the box.

I posted earlier this evening with a consolidation and small addition to what had been said on this page - that can be found at the bottom of this post. I am editing the post at this point, however, to post what I propose is (at least for my requirements, which include modifying pixel data) a better method, as it provides writable data (whereas, as I understand it, the method provided by previous posts and at the bottom of this post provides a read-only reference to data). 

Method 1: Writable Pixel Information


I defined constants

#define RGBA        4
#define RGBA_8_BIT  8

In my UIImage subclass I declared instance variables:

size_t bytesPerRow;
size_t byteCount;
size_t pixelCount;

CGContextRef context;
CGColorSpaceRef colorSpace;

UInt8 *pixelByteData;
// A pointer to an array of RGBA bytes in memory
RPVW_RGBAPixel *pixelData;

The pixel struct (with alpha in this version)

typedef struct RGBAPixel {
    byte red;
    byte green;
    byte blue;
    byte alpha;
} RGBAPixel;

Bitmap function (returns pre-calculated RGBA; divide RGB by A to get unmodified RGB):

-(RGBAPixel*) bitmap {
    NSLog( @""Returning bitmap representation of UIImage."" );
    // 8 bits each of red, green, blue, and alpha.
    [self setBytesPerRow:self.size.width * RGBA];
    [self setByteCount:bytesPerRow * self.size.height];
    [self setPixelCount:self.size.width * self.size.height];

    // Create RGB color space
    [self setColorSpace:CGColorSpaceCreateDeviceRGB()];

    if (!colorSpace)
    {
        NSLog(@""Error allocating color space."");
        return nil;
    }

    [self setPixelData:malloc(byteCount)];

    if (!pixelData)
    {
        NSLog(@""Error allocating bitmap memory. Releasing color space."");
        CGColorSpaceRelease(colorSpace);

        return nil;
    }

    // Create the bitmap context. 
    // Pre-multiplied RGBA, 8-bits per component. 
    // The source image format will be converted to the format specified here by CGBitmapContextCreate.
    [self setContext:CGBitmapContextCreate(
                                           (void*)pixelData,
                                           self.size.width,
                                           self.size.height,
                                           RGBA_8_BIT,
                                           bytesPerRow,
                                           colorSpace,
                                           kCGImageAlphaPremultipliedLast
                                           )];

    // Make sure we have our context
    if (!context)   {
        free(pixelData);
        NSLog(@""Context not created!"");
    }

    // Draw the image to the bitmap context. 
    // The memory allocated for the context for rendering will then contain the raw image pixelData in the specified color space.
    CGRect rect = { { 0 , 0 }, { self.size.width, self.size.height } };

    CGContextDrawImage( context, rect, self.CGImage );

    // Now we can get a pointer to the image pixelData associated with the bitmap context.
    pixelData = (RGBAPixel*) CGBitmapContextGetData(context);

    return pixelData;
}





Read-Only Data (Previous information) - method 2:



Step 1. I declared a type for byte:

typedef unsigned char byte;


Step 2. I declared a struct to correspond to a pixel:

typedef struct RGBPixel {

byte    red;
byte    green;
byte    blue;

}   RGBPixel;


Step 3. I subclassed UIImageView and declared (with corresponding synthesized properties):

//  Reference to Quartz CGImage for receiver (self)

CFDataRef       bitmapData; 

//  Buffer holding raw pixel data copied from Quartz CGImage held in receiver (self)

UInt8*          pixelByteData;

//  A pointer to the first pixel element in an array

RGBPixel*           pixelData;


Step 4. Subclass code I put in a method named bitmap (to return the bitmap pixel data):

//  Get the bitmap data from the receiver's CGImage (see UIImage docs)

[self   setBitmapData:  CGDataProviderCopyData( CGImageGetDataProvider( [self   CGImage] ) )];

//  Create a buffer to store bitmap data (unitialized memory as long as the data)

[self   setPixelBitData:    malloc( CFDataGetLength( bitmapData ) )];

//  Copy image data into allocated buffer

CFDataGetBytes( bitmapData, CFRangeMake( 0, CFDataGetLength( bitmapData ) ), pixelByteData );

//  Cast a pointer to the first element of pixelByteData

//  Essentially what we're doing is making a second pointer that divides the byteData's units differently - instead of dividing each unit as 1 byte we will divide each unit as 3 bytes (1 pixel).

pixelData   = (RGBPixel*) pixelByteData;

//  Now you can access pixels by index: pixelData[ index ]

NSLog( @""Pixel data one red (%i), green (%i), blue (%i)."", pixelData[0].red, pixelData[0].green, pixelData[0].blue );

//  You can determine the desired index by multiplying row * column.

return pixelData;


Step 5. I made an accessor method:

- (RGBPixel*)   pixelDataForRow:    (int)   row
        column:         (int)   column  {

    //  Return a pointer to the pixel data

    return &pixelData[ row * column ];      

}

7471,144460,2827.0,2008-09-27T20:59:46Z,144360,143,"Ok, they're fundamentally a pretty simple idea. A DHT gives you a dictionary-like interface, but the nodes are distributed across the network. The trick with DHTs is that the node that gets to store a particular key is found by hashing that key, so in effect your hash-table buckets are now independent nodes in a network.

This gives a lot of fault-tolerance and reliability, and possibly some performance benefit, but it also throws up a lot of headaches. For example, what happens when a node leaves the network, by failing or otherwise? And how do you redistribute keys when a node joins so that the load is roughly balanced. Come to think of it, how do you evenly distribute keys anyhow? And when a node joins, how do you avoid rehashing everything? (Remember you'd have to do this in a normal hash table if you increase the number of buckets).

One example DHT that tackles some of these problems is a logical ring of n nodes, each taking responsibility for 1/n of the keyspace. Once you add a node to the network, it finds a place on the ring to sit between two other nodes, and takes responsibility for some of the keys in its sibling nodes. The beauty of this approach is that none of the other nodes in the ring are affected; only the two sibling nodes have to redistribute keys.

For example, say in a three node ring the first node has keys 0-10, the second 11-20 and the third 21-30. If a fourth node comes along and inserts itself between nodes 3 and 0 (remember, they're in a ring), it can take responsibility for say half of 3's keyspace, so now it deals with 26-30 and node 3 deals with 21-25.  

There are many other overlay structures such as this that use content-based routing to find the right node on which to store a key. Locating a key in a ring requires searching round the ring one node at a time (unless you keep a local look-up table, problematic in a DHT of thousands of nodes), which is O(n)-hop routing. Other structures - including augmented rings - guarantee O(log n)-hop routing, and some claim to O(1)-hop routing at the cost of more maintenance.

It's possible to overload either of these to provide different behavior -- like identity testing for Equals() --, but for the sake of anybody reading your code, please don't.



Pointed out below: some types like String or DateTime provide overloads for the == operator that give it equality semantics. So the exact behavior will depend on the types of the objects you are comparing.

Here is what I do:

First, I keep packages separately and explain them in the end.

Ideally, in my opinion, students should first learn about ADTs, preferably in C. They have the struct, they have the separate operations on it. Fields are then simply the ""slots"" in the struct and you can even show the memory layout to demonstrate it. Functions are separate entities that operate on those structs. 

You then make the transition to classes, methods, and fields and show that in essence (barring inheritance and some anecdotes) they are in many ways syntactic sugar for ADTs.

If you need, you can then teach object layouts, inheritance, and virtual tables (in my experience it helps students understand inheritance better to see the memory layout).

Finally you get to the topic of how to organize classes together. If you teach C++, you don't really have packages but you can explain namespaces and discuss organization and separate compilation.

If you are in Java, then you just explain that these are collections of classes in the same namespace, that have special access rules and show them. The package system in Java is kind of broken anyway so I usually go through patterns (e.g., separating a UI package from the C). 

So in summary: Classes form the basis for objects that are a memory arrangement of several fields and associated methods that operate on them. Packages are collections of classes that have one more access restriction mechanism.

7511,144837,4733.0,2008-09-28T00:18:22Z,144730,25,"A few things to consider:


You need to account for parallax error when touching controls. Basically, the user may touch the screen above or below your actual control and therefore miss the control. This is a combination of the size of the control (eg you can have the active area larger than visual control to allow the user to miss and still activate the control), the viewing angle of the user (which you may or may not be able to predict/control) and the type of touch screen you're using. If you know where the user will be placed relative to the screen when using it, you can usually accommodate this with appropriate calibration.
Depending on the type of touch screen, you may need to ensure that your users aren't wearing gloves or using an implement other than their fingers (eg the end of a pen) to touch the screen. Some screens (eg those depending on conductance) don't respond well to anything other than flesh and blood.
Avoid using double clicks because it can be very hard for users to reliably double click a control. This can be partly mitigated if you've got experienced/trained users working in a fairly controlled environment where they're used to the screens.
Linked to the above, if you are using double clicks, you may find the double click activated when the user only wants to single click. This is because it's very easy for the user's finger to bounce slightly on touching the screen and, depending on how sensitive the double click settings are, trigger a double rather than a single click. For this and the previous reason, we always disable double clicks and only use single clicks (or similar single activation controls).
However big you think you need to make the controls to allow for touch activation, they almost certainly need to be bigger still. Make sure you test the interface with real users in the real deployment environment (or as close to it as you can get). For example, we deployed some screens with nice big buttons you couldn't miss only to find that the control room was unheated and that the users were wearing thick gloves in the middle of winter, making their fingers way bigger than we had allowed for.
Don't put any controls near the edges of the screen - it's very hard to get your finger into the edges (particularly if the screen has a deep bezel) and a slight calibration problem can easily shift the control too close to the edge to use. Standard menus and scroll bars are a good example of controls that can be very tricky to use on a touch screen and you should either avoid them (which is preferable - they're not good for touch screens) or replicate them with jumbo equivalents.
Remember that the user's hand will be over the screen, obscuring some of the screen and controls (typically those below where the user is touching, but it depends on the position of the user relative to the screen). Don't put instructions or indicators where the user's hand or arm will obscure them when trying to use the control they relate to (eg typically put them above rather than below the control).
Depending on the environment, make sure your touch screen is suitably proofed against dust, damp, grease etc and make sure it's easy to clean without damaging it. You wouldn't believe the slime that can quickly accumulate on a touch screen in an industrial or public setting.

Because of the versatility of the DAG in representing information, you could be discussing anything from a multiple-outcome control flow to argument clauses of non-adverbial discourse connectives or even the full set of dependencies between different words in a sentence.

All of these would view node strength in a different way.  For instance, a control flow may consider the node with the most amount of outcomes (therefore the most outward arcs) as the strongest, because it has the most power over the eventual outcome of the diagram.  In discourse, the strongest node is the discourse connective, but it is found in speech and text after the first connective and before the third.  Selection of the lexical ""head"" of a sentence is not directly related to the amount of arcs directly interacting with it.

What I'm getting at is that there is no real panacea for computing ""strength"" in this data type because of the polysemous character of the term ""strength"" and the kind of data a DAG fits.  I would say that in a machine learning problem, all three of these approaches would be very informative in selecting particular types of nodes for a classification or ranking problem, but in the end, the answer depends upon the data type's practical application.

I use a blocking queue so that when there are no items the process, the workers just block until something is pushed onto the queue. In this model, the master thread produces work items from some source (db, etc.) and the worker threads consume them.

7571,145559,14089.0,2008-09-28T09:35:40Z,145110,198,"JIT vs. Static Compiler

As already said in the previous posts, JIT can compile IL/bytecode into native code at runtime. The cost of that was mentionned, but not to its conclusion:

JIT has one massive problem is that it can't compile everything: JIT compiling takes time, so the JIT will compile only some parts of the code, whereas a static compiler will produce a full native binary: For some kind of programs, the static compiler will simply easily outperform the JIT.

Of course, C# (or Java, or VB) is usually faster to produce viable and robust solution than is C++ (if only because C++ has complex semantics, and C++ standard library, while interesting and powerful, is quite poor when compared with the full scope of the standard library from .NET or Java), so usually, the difference between C++ and .NET or Java JIT won't be visible to most users, and for those binaries that are critical, well, you can still call C++ processing from C# or Java (even if this kind of native calls can be quite costly in themselves)...

C++ metaprograming

Note that usually, you are comparing C++ runtime code with its equivalent in C# or Java. But C++ has one feature that can outperform Java/C# out of the box, that is template metaprograming: The code processing will be done at compilation time (thus, increasing vastly compilation time), resulting into zero (or almost zero) runtime.

I have yet so see a real life effect on this (I played only with concepts, but by then, the difference was seconds of execution for JIT, and zero for C++), but this is worth mentioning, alongside the fact template metaprograming is not trivial...


  Edit 2011-06-10: In C++, playing with types is done at compile time, meaning producing generic code which calls non-generic code (e.g. a generic parser from string to type T, calling standard library API for types T it recognizes, and making the parser easily extensible by its user) is very easy and very efficient, whereas the equivalent in Java or C# is painful at best to write, and will always be slower and resolved at runtime even when the types are known at compile time, meaning your only hope is for the JIT to inline the whole thing.


...


  Edit 2011-09-20: The team behind Blitz++ (Homepage, Wikipedia) went that way, and apparently, their goal is to reach FORTRAN's performance on scientific calculations by moving as much as possible from runtime execution to compilation time, via C++ template metaprogramming. So the ""I have yet so see a real life effect on this"" part I wrote above apparently does exist in real life.


Native C++ Memory Usage

C++ has a memory usage different from Java/C#, and thus, has different advantages/flaws.

No matter the JIT optimization, nothing will go has fast as direct pointer access to memory (let's ignore for a moment processor caches, etc.). So, if you have contiguous data in memory, accessing it through C++ pointers (i.e. C pointers... Let's give Caesar its due) will goes times faster than in Java/C#. And C++ has RAII, which makes a lot of processing a lot easier than in C# or even in Java. C++ does not need using to scope the existence of its objects. And C++ does not have a finally clause. This is not an error.

:-)

And despite C# primitive-like structs, C++ ""on the stack"" objects will cost nothing at allocation and destruction, and will need no GC to work in an independent thread to do the cleaning.

As for memory fragmentation, memory allocators in 2008 are not the old memory allocators from 1980 that are usually compared with a GC: C++ allocation can't be moved in memory, true, but then, like on a Linux filesystem: Who needs hard disk defragmenting when fragmentation does not happen? Using the right allocator for the right task should be part of the C++ developer toolkit. Now, writing allocators is not easy, and then, most of us have better things to do, and for the most of use, RAII or GC is more than good enough.


  Edit 2011-10-04: For examples about efficient allocators: On Windows platforms, since Vista, the Low Fragmentation Heap is enabled by default. For previous versions, the LFH can be activated by calling the WinAPI function HeapSetInformation). On other OSes, alternative allocators are provided (see https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Malloc for a list)


Now, the memory model is somewhat becoming more complicated with the rise of multicore and multithreading technology. In this field, I guess .NET has the advantage, and Java, I was told, held the upper ground. It's easy for some ""on the bare metal"" hacker to praise his ""near the machine"" code. But now, it is quite more difficult to produce better assembly by hand than letting the compiler to its job. For C++, the compiler became usually better than the hacker since a decade. For C# and Java, this is even easier.

Still, the new standard C++0x will impose a simple memory model to C++ compilers, which will standardize (and thus simplify) effective multiprocessing/parallel/threading code in C++, and make optimizations easier and safer for compilers. But then, we'll see in some couple of years if its promises are held true.

C++/CLI vs. C#/VB.NET

Note: In this section, I am talking about C++/CLI, that is, the C++ hosted by .NET, not the native C++.

Last week, I had a training on .NET optimization, and discovered that the static compiler is very important anyway. As important than JIT.

The very same code compiled in C++/CLI (or its ancestor, Managed C++) could be times faster than the same code produced in C# (or VB.NET, whose compiler produces the same IL than C#).

Because the C++ static compiler was a lot better to produce already optimized code than C#'s.

For example, function inlining in .NET is limited to functions whose bytecode is less or equal than 32 bytes in length. So, some code in C# will produce a 40 bytes accessor, which won't be ever inlined by the JIT. The same code in C++/CLI will produce a 20 bytes accessor, which will be inlined by the JIT.

Another example is temporary variables, that are simply compiled away by the C++ compiler while still being mentioned in the IL produced by the C# compiler. C++ static compilation optimization will result in less code, thus authorizes a more aggressive JIT optimization, again.

The reason for this was speculated to be the fact C++/CLI compiler profited from the vast optimization techniques from C++ native compiler.

Conclusion

I love C++.

But as far as I see it, C# or Java are all in all a better bet. Not because they are faster than C++, but because when you add up their qualities, they end up being more productive, needing less training, and having more complete standard libraries than C++. And as for most of programs, their speed differences (in one way or another) will be negligible...

Edit (2011-06-06)

My experience on C#/.NET

I have now 5 months of almost exclusive professional C# coding (which adds up to my CV already full of C++ and Java, and a touch of C++/CLI).

I played with WinForms (Ahem...) and WCF (cool!), and WPF (Cool!!!! Both through XAML and raw C#. WPF is so easy I believe Swing just cannot compare to it), and C# 4.0.

The conclusion is that while it's easier/faster to produce a code that works in C#/Java than in C++, it's a lot harder to produce a strong, safe and robust code in C# (and even harder in Java) than in C++. Reasons abound, but it can be summarized by:


Generics are not as powerful as templates (try to write an efficient generic Parse method (from string to T), or an efficient equivalent of boost::lexical_cast in C# to understand the problem)
RAII remains unmatched (GC still can leak (yes, I had to handle that problem) and will only handle memory. Even C#'s using is not as easy and powerful because writing a correct Dispose implementations is difficult)
C# readonly and Java final are nowhere as useful as C++'s const (There's no way you can expose readonly complex data (a Tree of Nodes, for example) in C# without tremendous work, while it's a built-in feature of C++. Immutable data is an interesting solution, but not everything can be made immutable, so it's not even enough, by far).


So, C# remains an pleasant language as long as you want something that works, but a frustrating language the moment you want something that always and safely works.

Java is even more frustrating, as it has the same problems than C#, and more: Lacking the equivalent of C#'s using keyword, a very skilled colleague of mine spent too much time making sure its resources where correctly freed, whereas the equivalent in C++ would have been easy (using destructors and smart pointers).

So I guess C#/Java's productivity gain is visible for most code... until the day you need the code to be as perfect as possible. That day, you'll know pain. (you won't believe what's asked from our server and GUI apps...).

About Server-side Java and C++

I kept contact with the server teams (I worked 2 years among them, before getting back to the GUI team), at the other side of the building, and I learned something interesting.

Last years, the trend was to have the Java server apps be destined to replace the old C++ server apps, as Java has a lot of frameworks/tools, and is easy to maintain, deploy, etc. etc..

...Until the problem of low-latency reared its ugly head the last months. Then, the Java server apps, no matter the optimization attempted by our skilled Java team, simply and cleanly lost the race against the old, not really optimized C++ server.

Currently, the decision is to keep the Java servers for common use where performance while still important, is not concerned by the low-latency target, and aggressively optimize the already faster C++ server applications for low-latency and ultra-low-latency needs.

Conclusion

Nothing is as simple as expected.

Java, and even more C#, are cool languages, with extensive standard libraries and frameworks, where you can code fast, and have result very soon.

But when you need raw power, powerful and systematic optimizations, strong compiler support, powerful language features and absolute safety, Java and C# make it difficult to win the last missing but critical percents of quality you need to remain above the competition.

It's as if you needed less time and less experienced developers in C#/Java than in C++ to produce average quality code, but in the other hand, the moment you needed excellent to perfect quality code, it was suddenly easier and faster to get the results right in C++.

Of course, this is my own perception, perhaps limited to our specific needs.

But still, it is what happens today, both in the GUI teams and the server-side teams.

Of course, I'll update this post if something new happens.

ResX is a storage format for storing resources in XML. It gets compiled to a binary form (.resources) with the resgen tool before it gets embedded (if so specified) into the assembly.

Satellite assembly is a diff/delta of your main assembly resources and your localized resources.

When you query for a string resource using a ResourceManager, it takes into account current culture. If fr-CA, it will first look for the string in the satellite assembly in the fr-CA folder, if not found it will fall back to the resources in the DLL itself and return that. The mechanism is to search for it in the following order always.

We also have tools that generate code that one one hand cannot be recycled, on the other it's always similar (think calling a stored procedure).
Pair programming is also a useful way to spread knowledge of existing solutions. We use that when possible or appropriate.

If you want to keep the SQL 2005 copy around and online until you know that the 2008 copy is working, you might need to move the data/log files for your database when restoring the backup onto 2008, since the old data files will be in use by 2005. You can do this using the with move option of restore database, for example:

RESTORE DATABASE mydb FROM disk = 'c:\backupfile.bak'
 WITH MOVE 'maindatafile' to 'c:\newdatalocation.mdf',
 MOVE 'mainlogfile' to 'c:\newloglocation.ldf'

As a pure language, D arguably has many advantages over C++ and Java.  At the very least it is a credible alternative as a pure language, all other things being equal.

However, other things matter for software development - almost more than the language itself: portability (how many platforms does it run on), debugger support, IDE support, standard library quality, dynamic library support, bindings for common APIs, documentation, the developer community, momentum, and commercial support, just to name a few.  In every one of those regards, D is hopelessly behind Java, C++, and C#.  In fact, I'd argue it's even behind so-called ""scripting"" languages like Python, Perl, PHP, Ruby, and even JavaScript in these regards.

To be blunt, you simply can't build a large-scale, cross-platform application using D.  With an immature standard library, no support in any modern IDEs (there are plugins for both Visual Studio and Xamarin Studio/MonoDevelop), limited dynamic/shared library support, and few bindings to other languages, D is simply not an option today.

If you like what you see of D, by all means, learn it - it shouldn't take long if you already know Java and C++.  I don't think evangelism would be helpful - at this point if D is going to succeed, what it really needs is more people quietly using it and addressing its major shortcomings like standard library and IDE support.

Finally, as for C++, while most agree the language is too complex, thousands of companies are successfully using C++ as part of a healthy mix of languages by allowing only a smaller, well-defined subset of the language.  It's still hard to beat C++ when both raw performance and small memory usage are required.

There are known issues with garbage collection, and understanding them helps understanding why there is none in C++.

1. Performance ?

The first complaint is often about performance, but most people don't really realize what they are talking about. As illustrated by Martin Beckett the problem may not be performance per se, but the predictability of performance.

There are currently 2 families of GC that are widely deployed:


Mark-And-Sweep kind
Reference-Counting kind


The Mark And Sweep is faster (less impact on overall performance) but it suffers from a ""freeze the world"" syndrom: ie when the GC kicks in, everything else is stopped until the GC has made its cleanup. If you wish to build a server that answers in a few milliseconds... some transactions will not live up to your expectations :)

The problem of Reference Counting is different: reference-counting adds overhead, especially in Multi-Threading environments because you need to have an atomic count. Furthermore there is the problem of reference cycles so you need a clever algorithm to detect those cycles and eliminate them (generally implement by a ""freeze the world"" too, though less frequent). In general, as of today, this kind (even though normally more responsive or rather, freezing less often) is slower than the Mark And Sweep.

I have a seen a paper by Eiffel implementers that were trying to implement a Reference Counting Garbage Collector that would have a similar global performance to Mark And Sweep without the ""Freeze The World"" aspect. It required a separate thread for the GC (typical). The algorithm was a bit frightening (at the end) but the paper made a good job of introducing the concepts one at a time and showing the evolution of the algorithm from the ""simple"" version to the full-fledged one. Recommended reading if only I could put my hands back on the PDF file...

2. Resources Acquisition Is Initialization

It's a common idiom in C++ that you will wrap the ownership of resources within an object to ensure that they are properly released. It's mostly used for memory since we don't have garbage collection, but it's also useful nonetheless for many other situations:


locks (multi-thread, file handle, ...)
connections (to a database, another server, ...)


The idea is to properly control the lifetime of the object:


it should be alive as long as you need it
it should be killed when you're done with it


The problem of GC is that if it helps with the former and ultimately guarantees that later... this ""ultimate"" may not be sufficient. If you release a lock, you'd really like that it be released now, so that it does not block any further calls!

Languages with GC have two work arounds:


don't use GC when stack allocation is sufficient: it's normally for performance issues, but in our case it really helps since the scope defines the lifetime
using construct... but it's explicit (weak) RAII while in C++ RAII is implicit so that the user CANNOT unwittingly make the error (by omitting the using keyword)


3. Smart Pointers

Smart pointers often appear as a silver bullet to handle memory in C++. Often times I have heard: we don't need GC after all, since we have smart pointers.

One could not be more wrong.

Smart pointers do help: auto_ptr and unique_ptr use RAII concepts, extremely useful indeed. They are so simple that you can write them by yourself quite easily.

When one need to share ownership however it gets more difficult: you might share among multiple threads and there are a few subtle issues with the handling of the count. Therefore, one naturally goes toward shared_ptr.

It's great, that's what Boost for after all, but it's not a silver bullet. In fact, the main issue with shared_ptr is that it emulates a GC implemented by Reference Counting but you need to implement the cycle detection all by yourself... Urg

Of course there is this weak_ptr thingy, but I have unfortunately already seen memory leaks despite the use of shared_ptr because of those cycles... and when you are in a Multi Threaded environment, it's extremely difficult to detect!

4. What's the solution ?

There is no silver bullet, but as always, it's definitely feasible. In the absence of GC one need to be clear on ownership:


prefer having a single owner at one given time, if possible
if not, make sure that your class diagram does not have any cycle pertaining to ownership and break them with subtle application of weak_ptr


So indeed, it would be great to have a GC... however it's no trivial issue. And in the mean time, we just need to roll up our sleeves.

If you are across physical layers on any of these service calls, ACA.NET will do the job, EntLib doesn't cut it just yet.

It will execute blah() and get something back (presumably), then the comma operator is employed and 5 will be the only thing that is used to determine the true/false value for the expression.



Note that the , operator could be overloaded for the return type of the blah() function (which wasn't specified), making the result non-obvious.

The issue seems to have been differing versions of the Validating JavaScript code. I fixed the issue by copying the aspnet_client\systemweb\1_1_4322\*.* directory from the root of IIS to the root of the website. The website I had transferred, already had code in this directory and it must have been a different Build version or something from the ASP running on the new server.

Apologies Mecki, if I was any good with JavaScript your answer would have lead me in the right direction, I'd say. 
Simon, it was while investigating your idea that I noticed the javascript includes for aspnet_client. End of the day the issue was fixed with trial and error on my part so I don't absolutely know what caused my problem. Thanks for helping.

Yea, no clue why you're doing this, but this will do the trick.

By performing a LOCATE, we can find the first ':'. To find the last ':', there's no reverse LOCATE, so we have to do it manually by performing a LOCATE(':', REVERSE(column)).

With the index of the first ':', the number of chars from the last ':' to the end of the string, and the CHAR_LENGTH (don't use LENGTH() for this), we can use a little math to discover the length of the string between the two instances of ':'.

This way we can peform a SUBSTR and dynamically pluck out the characters between the two ':'.

Again, it's gross, but to each his own.

Write a ShowDialog function that does what I want (e.g. return the value) or
Just let the result be a property in the dialog. This is how the common file dialogs do it in the BCL. The caller must then read the property to get the result. That's fine in my opinion.


You can also combine these methods, by making the result value a property in the dialog and creating a ShowDialog method that returns that property value, either as ByRef as you want or as a return value, depending on your needs.

I'll add this as a usage instruction, for example (sorry, no VB over here, and you said C# is welcome):

using (var dlg = new DeptPicker()) {
    if (dlg.ShowDialog() == DialogResult.OK) {
        myTextBoxOrWhatEver.Text = dlg.TargetResult;
    }
}


In the dialog itself, just do this:

void okButton_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    TargetResult = whatever; // can also do this when the selection changes
    DialogResult = DialogResult.OK;
    Close();
}

Since you're in explicit mode, I think you need to surround the DELETE operation with BEGIN TRANSACTION and COMMIT TRANSACTION statements.

Clarification: The reason you'd need to use transactions is that the delete doesn't actually happen in the database until you do a COMMIT operation.  This is generally used when you have multiple write operations in an atomic transaction.  Basically, you only want the changes to happen to the DB if all of the operations are successful.

In your case, there's only 1 operation, but since you're in explicit transaction mode, you need to tell SQL Server to really make the changes.

then, we can find the best result, and guarantee it, by maximizing (depth * frequency) which will be replaced with your escape character. You can optimize the search by doing a branch and bound depth first search for the maximum.

On the complexity: O(C), as mentioned in comment, for building it, and for finding the optimal, it depends. If you order the first elements frequency (O(A) --where A is the size of the languages alphabet), then you'll be able to cut out more branches, and have a good chance of getting sub-linear time.

Update

I recently encountered this issue myself and went digging for an answer. I wanted to perform some calculations during a paint (to leverage the unique handling of paint messages) but I wasn't always getting a call to OnPaint.

After digging around with Reflector, I discovered that OnPaint is only called if the clipping rectangle of the corresponding WM_PAINT message is not empty. My UserControl instance had a child control that filled its entire client region and therefore, clipped it all. This meant that the clipping rectangle was empty and so no OnPaint call.

I worked around this by overriding WndProc and adding a handler for WM_PAINT directly as I couldn't find another way to achieve what I wanted.

7884,151194,22767.0,2008-09-29T23:34:58Z,151100,4,"Yes your suggested solution will work. Given that you are working in a Java environment storing the images in the database is the best way to go. If you are running in a single server environment with an application server that will let you deploy in an exploded format technically you could store the images on disk but that wouldn't be the best practice. One suggestion would be to use a servlet instead of a JSP. To get good browser behavior you want the browser to think that the file type that it is displaying matches the file type that it is expecting. Despite the existence of mime type headers the file extension is still really important. So you want a link that looks like this:

<a href=""foo.jsp""><img src=""imageservlet/123456789.png""></a>


Where 123456789 is the primary key of your image in the database. Your servlet mapping would look like this:

<servlet>
  <servlet-name>ImageServlet</servlet-name>
  <servlet-class>com.example.ImageServlet</servlet-class>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
  <servlet-name>ImageServlet</servlet-name>
  <url-pattern>/imageservlet/*</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>


Then in your servlet simply parse the request URL for the image ID rather than using the query string as the query string will confuse some browsers. Using the query string won't break browsers outright but you'll get odd behavior with regards to caching and some browsers may report the content as unsafe.

There are many, many sites which generically block either large blocks of IP space or which geolocate and carve out big portions of the world.  

For example, a surprising number of American blogs block Asian countries (including Japan) out of a misplaced effort to avoid DDOS attacks (which actually probably originated in Russia or China but, hey, this species of administrator isn't very good on fine tuning solutions).  I have to hop over to my American proxy server to access those sites.

So the first thing I'd do to diagnose your problems is to see whether your Mexican users are making it to the server at all, or whether they're being blocked somewhere earlier (router?  firewall?  etc).  Then, to determine whether the problem is on your end or their end, I'd try to replicate the issue with you proxying your connection through a Mexican proxy and repeating the actions they took to cause the issue.  

The fact that they get blocked after logging in could indicate that you have https issues , for example with an HTTPS accelerator installed [1], or it could be that your frontend server is properly serving up the static content but doing the checking on dynamic requests only.

This IBM Developer Works article from August 2008 by Jorge Rasillo and Mike Burr shows how to do a Flex front-end / RESTful back-end app (examples in PHP and Groovy). Nice article. Anyway, here's the take away:


Their PHP/Groovy code uses and expects PUT and DELETE.
But the Flex code has to use POST, but sets the HTTP header X-Method-Override to DELETE (you can do the same for PUT I presume).
Note that this is not the Proxy method discussed above.



// Flex doesn't know how to generate an HTTP DELETE.
// Fortunately, sMash/Zero will interpret an HTTP POST with
// an X-Method-Override: DELETE header as a DELETE.
deleteTodoHS.headers['X-Method-Override'] = 'DELETE';

What's happening here? the IBM web server intercepts and interprets the ""POST with DELETE"" as a DELETE.

So, I dug further and found this post and discussion with Don Box (one of the original SOAP guys). Apparently this is a fairly standard behavior since some browsers, etc. do not support PUT and DELETE, and is a work-around that has been around a while. Here's a snippet, but there's much more discussion.


  ""If I were building a GData client, I honestly wonder why I'd bother using DELETE and PUT methods at all given that X-HTTP-Method-Override is going to work in more cases/deployments.""


My take away from this is that if your web side supports this X-Method-Override header, then you can use this approach. The Don Box comments make me think it's fairly well supported, but I've not confirmed that yet.

Another issue arises around being able to read the HTTP response headers. Again, from a blog post in 2007 by Nathan de Vries, we see this discussed. He followed up that blog post and discussion with his own comment:


  ""The only change on the web front is that newer versions of the Flash Player (certainly those supplied with the Flex 3 beta) now support the responseHeaders property on instances of HTTPStatusEvent.""


I'm hoping that means it is a non-issue now.

It provides symmetric encryption of arbitrary data, using the credentials of the machine or (better) the user, as the encryption key.  You don't have to worry about managing the keys; Windows takes care of that for you.  If the user changes his password, Windows will re-encrypt the data using the user's new password.

DPAPI is exposed in .NET with the System.Security.Cryptography.ProtectedData class:

byte[] plaintextBytes = GetDataToProtect();
byte[] encodedBytes = ProtectedData.Protect(plaintextBytes, null, DataProtectionScope.CurrentUser);


The second parameter of the Protect method is an optional entropy byte array, which can be used as an additional application-specific ""secret"".

To decrypt, use the ProtectedData.Unprotect call:

byte[] encodedBytes = GetDataToUnprotect();
byte[] plaintextBytes = ProtectedData.Unprotect(encodedBytes, null, DataProtectionScope.CurrentUser);


DPAPI works correctly with roaming profiles (as described here), though you'll need to store the encrypted data in a place (network share, IsolatedStorage with IsolatedStorageScope.Roaming, etc.) that your various machines can access.

See the ProtectedData class in MSDN for more information.  There's a DPAPI white paper here, with more information than you'd ever want.

What you need to do is keep track of everything that you're waiting for and fire off a custom event once all of those elements have loaded.

One possible hackish way to do it would be to listen for whatever load complete event is relevant for each element, then have them call back to the same function that increments a value equal to the number of components you're waiting for.  This means you have to pay more attention if you're modifying it, but it also means you don't have to check a boolean for every element that needs to load (IE ""if (image1Loaded && image2Loaded && swfLoaded)"" etc.)

I'm not saying it is an easy problem to solve, because it is more common than anything. But things that could help are:


Consider QA as members of the dev team, and include them in the sprint planning and estimating more closely.
'Releasable Dev tasks' should not take up most of the sprint. Complete working features should. Try to gather metrics about dev time vs QA time for each kind of task and use those metrics when estimating future sprints.
You might need to review your backlog to see if you have very coarse grained features. Try to divide them in smaller tasks that could be easily estimated and tested.


In summary, it seems that your team hasn't found what its real velocity is because there are tasks that are not being considered when doing the estimation and planning for the sprint.

But in the end, estimation inaccuracy is a tough project management issue that you find in agile-based or waterfall-based projects. Good luck.

8141,155296,1965.0,2008-09-30T22:00:04Z,155260,24,"That is the generic syntax for C#.

The basic concept is that it allows you to use a Type placeholder and substitute the actual real type in at compile time.

For example, the old way:

ArrayList foos = new Arraylist();
foos.Add(""Test"");


worked by making ArrayList store a list of System.Objects (The base type for all things .NET).

So, when adding or retrieving an object from the list, The CLR would have to cast it to object, basically what really happens is this:

foos.Add(""Test"" as System.Object);
string s = foos[1] as String.


This causes a performance penalty from the casting, and its also unsafe because I can do this:

ArrayList listOfStrings = new ArrayList();
listOfStrings.Add(1);
listOfStrings.Add(""Test"");


This will compile just fine, even though I put an integer in listOfStrings.

Generics changed all of this, now using Generics I can declare what Type my collection expects:

List<int> listOfIntegers = new List<int>();
List<String> listOfStrings = new List<String>();

listOfIntegers.add(1);

// Compile time error.
listOfIntegers.add(""test"");


This provides compile-time type safety, as well as avoids expensive casting operations.

The way you leverage this is pretty simple, though there are some advanced edge cases. The basic concept is to make your class type agnostic by using a type placeholder, for example, if I wanted to create a generic ""Add Two Things"" class.

public class Adder<T>
{
   public T AddTwoThings(T t1, T t2)
   {
       return t1 + t2;
   }
}

Adder<String> stringAdder = new Adder<String>();
Console.Writeline(stringAdder.AddTwoThings(""Test,""123""));

Adder<int> intAdder = new Adder<int>();
Console.Writeline(intAdder.AddTwoThings(2,2));


For a much more detailed explanation of generics, I can't recommend enough the book CLR via C#.

  The SafeHandle class provides critical
  finalization of handle resources,
  preventing handles from being
  reclaimed prematurely by garbage
  collection and from being recycled by
  Windows to reference unintended
  unmanaged objects. Before the .NET
  Framework version 2.0, all operating
  system handles could only be
  encapsulated in the IntPtr managed
  wrapper object.
  
  The SafeHandle class contains a
  finalizer that ensures that the handle
  is closed and is guaranteed to run,

  unloads when a host may not trust the
  consistency of the state of the
  AppDomain. 
  
  For more information about the
  benefits of using a SafeHandle, see
  Safe Handles and Critical
  Finalization.
  
  This class is abstract because you
  cannot create a generic handle. To
  implement SafeHandle, you must create
  a derived class. To create SafeHandle
  derived classes, you must know how to
  create and free an operating system
  handle. This process is different for
  different handle types because some
  use CloseHandle, while others use more
  specific methods such as
  UnmapViewOfFile or FindClose. For this
  reason, you must create a derived
  class of SafeHandle for each operating
  system handle type; such as
  MySafeRegistryHandle,
  MySafeFileHandle, and
  MySpecialSafeFileHandle. Some of these
  derived classes are prewritten and

I tend to see branch-crazy development in shops where the programming tasks are far too big to complete predictably and so management wants to wait until just before a release to determine what features should ship.  If you are doing that kind of work, then you might consider using distributed version control, where EVERY working directory is a branch naturally and you get all the local check-in and local history you can eat without hurting anyone.  You can even cross-merge with other developers outside of the trunk.

My preference is when we work in an unstable trunk with branches for release candidates, which are then tagged for release, and which then become the stream for emergency patches.  In such a system, you very seldom have more than three branches (last release, current release candidate, unstable trunk).  This works if you are doing TDD and have CI on the unstable trunk.  And if you require all tasks to be broken down so you can deliver code as often as you desire (usually a task should be only one to two days, and releasable without all the other tasks that compose its feature).  So programmers take work, check-out the trunk, do the work, sync up and check in any time all the tests pass. The unstable trunk is always available to branch as a release candidate (if all tests pass) and therefore release becomes a non-event.

Overall, better means: fewer branches, shorter tasks, shorter time to release, more tests.

While the @Object format isn't identical to the Guice style (centralized wiring vs. wiring information in each class), it is a valuable way to wire your python app.
Aspect-oriented Programming - apply interceptors in a horizontal programming paradigm (instead of vertical OOP inheritance) for things like transactions, security, and caching.
DatabaseTemplate - Reading from the database requires a monotonous cycle of opening cursors, reading rows, and closing cursors, along with exception handlers. With this template class, all you need is the SQL query and row-handling function. Spring Python does the rest.
Database Transactions - Wrapping multiple database calls with transactions can make your code hard to read. This module provides multiple ways to define transactions without making things complicated.
Security - Plugin security interceptors to lock down access to your methods, utilizing both authentication and domain authorization.
Remoting - It is easy to convert your local application into a distributed one. If you have already built your client and server pieces using the IoC container, then going from local to distributed is just a configuration change.
Samples - to help demonstrate various features of Spring Python, some sample applications have been created:

PetClinic - Spring Framework's sample web app has been rebuilt from the ground up using python web containers including: CherryPy. Go check it out for an example of how to use this framework. (NOTE: Other python web frameworks will be added to this list in the future).
Spring Wiki - Wikis are powerful ways to store and manage content, so we created a simple one as a demo!
Spring Bot - Use Spring Python to build a tiny bot to manage the IRC channel of your open source project.

It doesn't come with mercurial, but it can be installed by cloning the repository:

hg clone http://hg.kublai.com/mercurial/extensions/rdiff


And then modifing your ~/.hgrc file to load the extension:

[extensions] 
rdiff=~/path/to/rdiff/repo/rdiff.py


It's a little quirky in that it actually modifies the existing ""hg diff"" command by detecting if the first parameter is a remote URL.  If it is then it will diff that file against your tip file in your local repo (not the working copy).  This as the remote repo is first in the arguments, it's the reverse of what I'd expect, but you can pass ""--reverse"" to the hg diff command to switch that around.

I could see these being potential enhancements to the extension, but for now, I can work around them with a bash/zsh shell function in my starup file.  It does a temp checkin of my working copy (held by the mercurial transaction so it can be rolled back), executes the reverse diff, and then rolls the transaction back to return things back to the way they were:

hgrdiff() {
    hg commit -m ""temp commit for remote diff"" && 
    hg diff --reverse http://my_hardcoded_repo $* &&
    hg rollback      # revert the temporary commit

However, the python docs say that clock should be used for benchmarking. Note that clock behaves different in separate systems:


on MS Windows, it uses the Win32 function QueryPerformanceCounter(), with ""resolution typically better than a microsecond"". It has no special meaning, it's just a number (it starts counting the first time you call clock in your process).



    # ms windows
    t0= time.clock()
    do_something()
    t= time.clock() - t0 # t is wall seconds elapsed (floating point)



on *nix, clock reports CPU time. Now, this is different, and most probably the value you want, since your program hardly ever is the only process requesting CPU time (even if you have no other processes, the kernel uses CPU time now and then). So, this number, which typically is smallerÂ¹ than the wall time (i.e. time.time() - t0), is more meaningful when benchmarking code:



    # linux
    t0= time.clock()
    do_something()
    t= time.clock() - t0 # t is CPU seconds elapsed (floating point)


Apart from all that, the timeit module has the Timer class that is supposed to use what's best for benchmarking from the available functionality.

Â¹ unless threading gets in the wayâ¦

Â² Python â¥3.3: there are time.perf_counter() and time.process_time(). perf_counter is being used by the timeit module.

8246,156718,1109.0,2008-10-01T08:36:07Z,156610,7,"I guess you know the basics of how to localize a Flex application, but if you would like to know more there's a good and thorough description here: Runtime Localization.

In Flex 3 you have three options on how to solve your problem:


compile all languages into the SWF and switch language at runtime
compile a separate SWF for each language
compile no, or a default, language into the SWF and load additional languages at runtime


The first option is probably the most common, the least complex and doesn't have many drawbacks. The other two can be used if you have special needs, like having to keep down the size of the SWF at all cost, or need to load all strings from a database at runtime.

To implement the first option you create a resource bundle for each language (basically a number of .properties files that lives in a directory named after the locale, for example en_US for US English or sv_SE for Swedish). In the code you refer to strings by calling the resource manager:

<Label text=""{resourceManager.getString('mybundle', 'mystring"")'}/>


That will retrieve a string called ""mystring"" in the resource bundle compiled from ""mybundle.properties"" in the current locale.

To make sure each locale is actually compiled into the application you add -locale=en_US,sv_SE to the compiler flags (but change the en_US,sv_SE part to the languages you have resource bundles for). You also need to add the location of the directories to the source path: -source-path+=locale/{locale} (the ""{locale}"" part will automatically be replaced by the values of the -locale flag).

Now you have compiled all your languages into the SWF and can change languages at runtime. The way to do that is to modify the localeChain property of the resource manager:

resourceManager.localeChain = [""sv_SE"", ""en_US""];


With the settings shown above the resource manager will first look in the Swedish resource bundle, and secondly in the one for US English. You can set another order at any time, and doing so will change all texts in the application then and there.

I encourage you to read the description I referred to above, it explains this in greater detail, and most likely in a more understandable way. It also explains how to do some preparations you need to do before you can compile applications with locales other than en_US.

The other problem you have is with fonts. That one is trickier. The best thing would be to have a font that had the full Unicode range of characters, that way you would only need to embed that and any text could be displayed. However, that means that your options are a bit more limited. I know that there is at least one version of Aria in Windows that has an enourmous number of characters, and on the Mac there is a Helvetica (I think, or it might be Lucida Grande, or both) that also has most of the ones you need to display many asian languages.

Embedding all languages into the same SWF usually does very little to increase the file size, because text is very lightweight, but fonts are definitely not. Embedding a the whole Unicode version of Arial can increase the file size of a SWF by several megabyte, which kind of sucks for web applications. Depending on the situation you may have to compile one SWF per language, just because the font data would otherwise make the SWF unwieldy.

Runtime effectivity - does the compiled code run fast, or would it be faster doing it differently?
Code maintainability  - Is it easy (for another developer) to understand what is happening here? 


If it is faster and the code is more readable by doing everything in one loop, do it that way. If it is slower and less readable, do it another way. 

If it is faster and less readably, or slower but more readable, find out which of the factors matters more in your specific case, and then decide how to loop (or not to loop).

  single character of white space inside
  the TD containing the control.

If you have the following HTML:

<div id=""menu"" style=""display: none;"">
   <!-- menu stuff in here -->
   <ul><li>Menu item</li></ul>
</div>

<div class=""parent"">Hover over me to show the menu here</div>


then you can use the following JavaScript code:

$("".parent"").mouseover(function() {
    // .position() uses position relative to the offset parent, 
    var pos = $(this).position();

    // .outerWidth() takes into account border and padding.
    var width = $(this).outerWidth();

    //show the menu directly over the placeholder
    $(""#menu"").css({
        position: ""absolute"",
        top: pos.top + ""px"",
        left: (pos.left + width) + ""px""
    }).show();
});


But it doesn't work!

This will work as long as the menu and the placeholder have the same offset parent. If they don't, and you don't have nested CSS rules that care where in the DOM the #menu element is, use:

$(this).append($(""#menu""));


just before the line that positions the #menu element.

But it still doesn't work!

You might have some weird layout that doesn't work with this approach. In that case, just use jQuery.ui's position plugin (as mentioned in an answer below), which handles every conceivable eventuality. Note that you'll have to show() the menu element before calling position({...}); the plugin can't position hidden elements.

Update notes 3 years later in 2012:

(The original solution is archived here for posterity)

So, it turns out that the original method I had here was far from ideal. In particular, it would fail if:


the menu's offset parent is not the placeholder's offset parent
the placeholder has a border/padding


Luckily, jQuery introduced methods (position() and outerWidth()) way back in 1.2.6 that make finding the right values in the latter case here a lot easier. For the former case, appending the menu element to the placeholder works (but will break CSS rules based on nesting).

  Return Value
  
  A number equal to x - (y Q), where Q is the quotient of x / y rounded to the nearest integer (if x / y falls halfway between two integers, the even integer is returned).

*/


Epilogue

The actual question could be, ""Why do we have two remainder operations?"" When dealing with 
 floating point data, you always need to be cognizant of your floating point standard. Since we're in the 21st century, most everything is on IEEE 754 and very few of us worry about say VAX F_Float versus IEEE 754.

The C# standard states that the remainder operator (Section 7.7.3), when applied to floating point arguments, is analogous to the remainder operator when applied to integer arguments. That is, the same mathematical formula1 is used (with additional considerations for corner cases associated with floating point representations) in both integer and floating point remainder operations.

Therefore, if you are looking to have your remainder operations on floating point numbers conform to your current IEEE 754 rounding modes, it is advisable to use Math.IEEERemainder. However, if your usage is not particularly sensitive to the subtle difference in rounding produced by the C# remainder operator, then continue using the operator.


Given: z = x % y, then z = x - (x / y) * y

Then its really easy to switch your test case from any of the available components and most importantly Camel comes with some really handy Mock Endpoints which makes it super easy to test complex routing logic particularly with asynchronous operations.

If you also use Spring, then maybe start by trying out these Spring unit tests with mock endpoints in Camel which let you inject the mock endpoints to perform assertions on together with the ProducerTemplate object to make it really easy to fire your messages for your test case. e.g. see the last example on that page.

Start off using simple endpoints like the SEDA endpoint - then when you've got your head around the core spring/mock framework, try using the JMS endpoint or FTP endpoint endpoints etc.

  Absolute length units are highly dependent on the output medium, and 
  so are less useful than relative units. The following absolute units 
  are available:
  
  
  in (inches; 1in=2.54cm)
  cm (centimeters; 1cm=10mm)
  mm (millimeters)
  pt (points; 1pt=1/72in)
  pc (picas; 1pc=12pt)
  


Since you don't know how many characters your text is yet, you may need to use a combination of javascript and CSS in order to dynamically set the font-size property correctly. For example, take the length of the string in characters, and divide 8.5 (assuming you're expecting US letter size paper) by the number of characters and that gives you the size in inches to set the font-size to for that chunk of text. Tested the font-size with absolute measurements in Firefox, Safari, and IE6 so it should be pretty portable. Hope that helps.

EDIT: Note that you may also need to play around with settings such as the letter-spacing property as well and experiment with what font you use, since the font-size setting isn't really the width of the letters, which will be different based on letter-spacing, and font, proportional to length. Oh, and using a monospace font helps ;)

NTLM uses a challenge/response mechanism, so the password is never transmitted.  Your server must have access to a password-equivalent (a hash) in order to form the challenge and check the response, but even if you can get hold of it that password-equivalent will be no use to you in trying to form credentials that will be accepted by server B.

If you can set up impersonation, as described in another answer, even that doesn't necessarily get you what you want.  By default, an impersonating server process is not allowed to transmit its identity to another server.  That second hop is known as delegation and needs to be configured explicitly on the servers involved (and/or in Active Directory).

Apart from delegation I think your only option is to maintain a database of credentials that server A can access and present to server B.  Building that in a secure manner is a subtle and time-consuming process.  On the other hand, there is a reason why delegation is disabled by default.  When I log into a server, do I want it to be allowed to use my identity for accessing other servers?  Delegation is the simplest option for you, but you'll need to be sure that server A can't be compromised to do irresponsible things with your users' identities.

The arc4random man page:


NAME
     arc4random, arc4random_stir, arc4random_addrandom -- arc4 random number generator

LIBRARY
     Standard C Library (libc, -lc)

SYNOPSIS
     #include <stdlib.h>

     u_int32_t
     arc4random(void);

     void
     arc4random_stir(void);

     void
     arc4random_addrandom(unsigned char *dat, int datlen);

DESCRIPTION
     The arc4random() function uses the key stream generator employed by the arc4 cipher, which uses 8*8 8
     bit S-Boxes.  The S-Boxes can be in about (2**1700) states.  The arc4random() function returns pseudo-
     random numbers in the range of 0 to (2**32)-1, and therefore has twice the range of rand(3) and
     random(3).

     The arc4random_stir() function reads data from /dev/urandom and uses it to permute the S-Boxes via
     arc4random_addrandom().

     There is no need to call arc4random_stir() before using arc4random(), since arc4random() automatically
     initializes itself.

EXAMPLES
     The following produces a drop-in replacement for the traditional rand() and random() functions using
     arc4random():

           #define foo4random() (arc4random() % ((unsigned)RAND_MAX + 1))

if (x % 2) { /* x is odd */ }


A few people have criticized my answer above stating that using x & 1 is ""faster"" or ""more efficient"". I do not believe this to be the case. 

Out of curiosity, I created two trivial test case programs:

/* modulo.c */
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int x;
    for (x = 0; x < 10; x++)

        if (x & 1)
            printf(""%d is odd\n"", x);
    return 0;
}


I then compiled these with gcc 4.1.3 on one of my machines 5 different times:


With no optimization flags.
With -O
With -Os
With -O2
With -O3


I examined the assembly output of each compile (using gcc -S) and found that in each case, the output for and.c and modulo.c were identical (they both used the andl $1, %eax instruction). I doubt this is a ""new"" feature, and I suspect it dates back to ancient versions. I also doubt any modern (made in the past 20 years) non-arcane compiler, commercial or open source, lacks such optimization. I would test on other compilers, but I don't have any available at the moment.

If anyone else would care to test other compilers and/or platform targets, and gets a different result, I'd be very interested to know.

Finally, the modulo version is guaranteed by the standard to work whether the integer is positive, negative or zero, regardless of the implementation's representation of signed integers. The bitwise-and version is not. Yes, I realise two's complement is somewhat ubiquitous, so this is not really an issue.

However, if you're able to use the GNU C extensions, or to use the newer and better C99 standard instead (use the --std=c99 option), then initializers such as this are perfectly legal.  The C99 standard has been out for, well, 9 years, and most C compilers support it quite well... especially this feature.

The parameters identify the very specific method you need (if there are several overloaded available, if the method has no arguments, only give methodName).

Then you invoke that method by calling

try {
  method.invoke(obj, arg1, arg2,...);

In passive FTP mode it is the client who initiates both the initial and the data connections. Since HTTP proxies can tunnel arbitrary outgoing TCP connections (using the CONNECT method), it should be possible to access an FTP server in passive mode via an HTTP proxy.

The FtpWebRequest seems to support passive mode. However, I don't understand why file download and directory listings are supported, whereas file upload, which also uses the same data connection, is not.

Have you confirmed that FtpWebRequest configured for passive mode does not work via an HTTP proxy through which directory listings/file download work just fine?

The most important thing is that you take the time and effort to set up the environment properly so that when your tests run they are using the correct directories, variables, etc. This way you shouldn't get the 'compilation errors' that you would get when running Eclipse and Ant.

Maven has the ability to run all your tests for you during the testing cycle of compilation, this should stop the need for any Ant tasks to run the tests. However, if you still need to have scripts for other tasks (generation of code, etc) then be weary of Maven's ability to generate code and not include it in the compiled binaries (jar, war), though this may well be fixed for newer versions of Maven.

At the end of the day it would be best to evaluate Maven 2 and see if it's right for you. It sounds like you're having (sarcasm)a lot of fun (/sarcasm) with Ant and Eclipse already though. :)

The object is initialized and processed in different binary modules with incompatible linking (such as C-run times)
If the class/structure is shared it is not exported/imported correctly.
The class(s) are defined in more than one place, and you are not including the correct definitions.


The above three are the most likely causes, especially, if all fields are reset to their default initialized values.

if this is only happening with only one or two fields, the structure may be poorly aligned and you may need to rearrange the fields to correct these (check that in release too).

In general, I am tempted to hypothesize that the object you have intialized is not the one RefreshCommProperties() sees, for some reason, may be one of the three above.

Create a new column and set the data type to TIMESTAMP. SS2005 automatically updates this type when the row is updated. The only problem is that this 'timestamp' has nothing at all to do with a date or time, it is just a number that reflects the last successful update of that row (any update, not just via replication). If that is all you need, then you should be fine. 

If you need the last replication update, things might get a bit tricky, and you need get your hands dirty with triggers and stored procs.

with sql server it will not roll back unless you are specifically running in the context of a transaction and you rollback that transaction, or the connection closes without the transaction having been committed. but i don't see a transaction context in your above query.

you could also try re-structuring your query to make the deletes a little more efficient, but essentially if the specs of your box are not up to snuff then you might be stuck waiting it out.

Here are just a small set of things game development has taught me:


Optimization for speed
Sacrificing computational depth for speed
Developing under small constraints of memory
Building a system that works like an operating system but is geared toward speed.
Keeping hundreds to thousands of objects in a tree, each with their own unique characteristics
Some areas of game development have great academic value (like Artificial Intelligence, Procedural Algorithms, etc)
It doesn't matter how much of a hack the code is, as long as the gameplay is there. Translating this to other disciplines, the objective of programming is to make the customers happy, regardless of how clever or ugly your code is.
