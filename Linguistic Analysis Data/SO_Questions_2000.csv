a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collectible_card_game"">trading card game</a>, and I wanted to implement the function of the cards as a script.</p>

<p>What I mean is that I essentially have an interface, <code>ICard</code>, which a card class implements (<code>public class Card056 : ICard</code>) and which contains function that are called by the game.</p>

<p>Now, to make the thing maintainable/moddable, I would like to have the class for each card as source code in the database and essentially compile it on first use. So when I have to add/change a card, I'll just add it to the database and tell my application to refresh, without needing any assembly deployment (especially since we would be talking about 1 assembly per card which means hundreds of assemblies).</p>

<p>Is that possible? Register a class from a source file and then instantiate it, etc.</p>

<pre><code>ICard Cards[current] = new MyGame.CardLibrary.Card056();
Cards[current].OnEnterPlay(ref currentGameState);

<p>The book suggests that in a scenario like mine, a good solution would be to nest the workhorse classes inside the interface class, so there are no separate files for classes the client is not meant to use, and to avoid any possible naming conflicts? I don't know about these justifications. Nested classes are a new concept to me. Just want to see what programmers think about the issue.</p>

Now, there is a development and a live one. As this should be part of a buildscript (standard windows batch, even do with current complexity of those scripts, i might switch to PowerShell or so later), Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count.</p>

<p>Would you just copy the .mdf File and attach it? I am always a bit careful when working with binary data, as this seems to be a compatiblity issue (even though development and live should run the same version of the server at all time).</p>

<p>Or - given the lack of ""EXPLAIN CREATE TABLE"" in T-SQL - do you do something that exports an existing database into SQL-Scripts which you can run on the target server? If yes, is there a tool that can automatically dump a given Database into SQL Queries and that runs off the command line? (Again, Enterprise Manager/Management Studio Express do not count).</p>

<p>And lastly - given the fact that the live database already contains data, the deployment may not involve creating all tables but rather checking the difference in structure and ALTER TABLE the live ones instead, which may also need data verification/conversion when existing fields change.</p>

<p>Now, i hear a lot of great stuff about the <a href=""http://www.red-gate.com/products/index.htm"">Red Gate</a> products, but for hobby projects, the price is a bit steep.</p>

The problem we have at the moment is that we need to write registry entries to <code>HKCU</code> for every user on the computer. They need to be in the <code>HKCU</code> rather than <code>HKLM</code> because they are the default user settings, and they do change per user. My feeling is that</p>

I don't really know anything about the Users root key, and haven't seen User/Machine Hive. Can anyone enlighten me on what they are? Perhaps they could solve my problem above.</p>

To find the peak value we currently search the array for the highest reading and use the index to determine the timing of the peak value which is used in our calculations.</p>

<p>This works well if the highest value is the peak we are looking for but if the device is not working correctly we can see a second peak which can be higher than the initial peak. We take 10 readings a second from 16 devices over a 90 second period.</p>

<p>My initial thoughts are to cycle through the readings checking to see if the previous and next points are less than the current to find a peak and construct an array of peaks. Maybe we should be looking at a average of a number of points either side of the current position to allow for noise in the system. Is this the best way to proceed or are there better techniques?</p>

<p>EDIT:
The goal is find the date and time that you get as a result of adding several hours to the current time. This is used to determine a default value for a due date of a submission. I want to add 3 hours to the current time to get the due date time. However, I don't want due dates that go beyond 5pm on the current day. So, I tried to have the hours split between (today, up to 5pm) and (tomorrow, from 8am on), such that adding 3 hours to 4pm would give you 19am, because 1 hour is added to the end of today and 2 hours are added to the beginning of tomorrow.</p>

I pointed them to Telligent's Community Server and  we had a sales like meeting today to get the Marketing folks on board. 
My question is if anyone has had issues working with Community Server, skinning it and extending it?<br>
I wanted to explain a bit why I am thinking Community Server, the company is wanting multiple blogs with multiple authors.  I want to be out of the admin part of this as much as possible and didn't think there were too many engines that having multiple blogs didn't mean db work.  I also like the other functionality that Community Server provides and think the company will find it useful, particularly the media section as right now we have some really shotty way of dealing with whitepapers and stuff.</p>

<p>edit: We are actually using the Sitecore blog module for a single blog on our intranet (which is actually what the CMS is serving).  Some reasoning for why I don't like it for our public site are they are on different servers, it doesn't support multiple authors, there is no built in syndication, it is a little flimsy feeling to me from looking at the source and I personally think the other features of Community Server make its price tag worth it.</p>

<p>another edit: Need to stick to .net software that run on sql server in my company's case, but I don't mind seeing recommendations for others.  ExpressionEngine looks promising, will try it out on my personal box.</p>"

Because guids are non-sequential (and they're client-side generated so I can't use newsequentialid()), I have made a non-primary, non-clustered index on this ID field rather than giving the tables a clustered primary key.</p>

<p>I'm wondering what the performance implications are for this approach. I've seen some people suggest that tables should have an auto-incrementing (""identity"") int as a clustered primary key even if it doesn't have any meaning, as it means that the database engine itself can use that value to quickly look up a row instead of having to use a bookmark.</p>

<p>My database is merge-replicated across a bunch of servers, so I've shied away from identity int columns as they're a bit hairy to get right in replication.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts? Should tables have primary keys? Or is it ok to not have any clustered indexes if there are no sensible columns to index that way?</p>

In your business logic layer you have described your business objects: getters, setters, accessors, and so on... you get the idea. The interface to the business logic layer guarantees safe usage of the business logic, so all the methods and accessors you call will validate input. </p>

<p>This great when you first write the UI code, because you have a neatly defined interface that you can trust.</p>

<p>But here comes the tricky part, when you start writing the data access layer, the interface to the business logic does not accommodate your needs. You need to have more accessors and getters to set fields which are/used to be hidden. Now you are forced to erode the interface of your business logic; now it is possible set fields from the UI layer, which the UI layer has no business setting. </p>

<p>Because of the changes needed for the data access layer, the interface to the business logic has eroded to the point where it is possible to even set the business logic with invalid data. Thus, the interface does not guarantee safe usage anymore.</p>

<p>I hope I explained the problem clearly enough. How do you prevent interface eroding, maintain information hiding and encapsulation, and yet still accommodate different interface needs among different layers? </p>

<p>According to <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc164128.aspx"">this msdn article</a>, doing this will not scale well because an asp.net worker thread is blocked for each remoting RPC. It advises switching to async handlers to free up asp.net worker threads.</p>

<p>One viewpoint is that the data layer should be aware of business objects (our own classes that represent an entity), and be able to work with that object natively.  </p>

<p>The opposing viewpoint is that the data layer should be object-agnostic, and purely handle simple data types (strings, bools, dates, etc.)</p>

<p>I can see that both approaches may be valid, but my own viewpoint is that I prefer the former.  That way, if the data storage medium changes, the business layer doesn't (necessarily) have to change to accommodate the new data layer.  It would therefore be a trivial thing to change from a SQL data store to a serialized xml filesystem store.</p>

<p>My colleague's point of view is that the data layer shouldn't have to know about object definitions, and that as long as the data is passed about appropriately, that is enough.  </p>

<p>Now, I know that this is one of those questions that has the potential to start a religious war, but I'd appreciate any feedback from the community on how you approach such things.  </p>

Say that I have a view which can accept drag and drop, but only in certain areas. Once the user drags over one of these areas I call <code>DragManager.acceptDrag(this)</code> (from a <code>DragEvent.DRAG_OVER</code> handler), but if the user then moves out of this area I'd like to change the status of the drag to not accepted and show the <code>DragManager.NONE</code> feedback. However, neither calling <code>DragManager.acceptDrag(null)</code> nor <code>DragManager.showFeedback(DragManager.NONE)</code> seems to have any effect. Once I've accepted the drag an set the feedback type I can't seem to change it.</p>

<p>Just to make it clear: the areas where the user should be able to drop are not components or even display objects, in fact they are just ranges in the text of a text field (like the selection). Had they been components of their own I could have solved it by making each of them accept drag events individually. I guess I could create proxy components that float over the text to emulate it, but I'd rather not if it isn't necessary.</p>

<hr>

<p>I've managed to get it working in both AIR and the browser now, but only by putting proxy components on top of the ranges of text where you should be able to drop things. That way I get the right feedback and drops are automatically unaccepted on drag exit.</p>

<p>This is the oddest thing about D&amp;D in AIR:</p>

<pre><code>DragManager.doDrag(initiator, source, event, dragImage, offsetX, offsetY);
</code></pre>

<p>In browser-based Flex, <code>offsetX</code> and <code>offsetY</code> should be negative (so says the documentation, and it works fine). However, when running <em>exactly the same code</em> in AIR you have to make the offsets positive. The same numbers, but positive. That is very, very weird.</p>

<p>I've tested some more and what <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10870/how-can-i-unaccept-a-drag-in-flex#11209"">@maclema</a> works, but not if you run in AIR. It seems like drag and drop in AIR is different. It's really, really weird because not only is the feedback not showing correctly, and it's not possible to unaccept, but the coordinates are also completely off. I just tried my application in a browser instead of AIR and dragging and dropping is completely broken.</p>

<p>So a new virtual machine would be created (from a template is fine, with the OS installed, and some base software installed) --- a new web site would be created in IIS, and the web app build output copied to a location on the virtual machine hard disk, and IIS configured correctly, the VM would start up and run.</p>

Since many hosting companies offer a single database with their hosting plans (with additional databases costing extra) it is very useful for your users when your database objects (tables, views, constraints, and stored procedures) have a common prefix. It is typical for applications aware of database scarcity to have a hard-coded table prefix. I want more, however. Specifically, I'd like to have a table prefix that users can designate&mdash;say in the web.config file (with an appropriate default, of course).</p>

<p>Since I hate coding <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create%2C_read%2C_update_and_delete"" rel=""nofollow"">CRUD</a> operations by hand, I prefer to work through a competent OR/M and have used (and enjoyed) LINQ to SQL, Subsonic, and ADO.Net. I'm having some thrash in a new project, however, when it comes to putting a table prefix in a user's web.config file. Are there any .Net-based OR/M products that can handle this scenario elegantly?</p>

<p>The best I have been able to come up with so far is using LINQ to SQL with an external mapping file that I'd have to update somehow based on an as-yet hypothetical web.config setting.</p>

<p>Anyone have a better solution? I tried to make it happen in Entity Framework, but that turned into a mess quickly. (Due to my unfamiliarity with EF? Possibly.) How about SubSonic? Does it have an option to apply a table prefix besides at code generation time?</p>

<p>The app contains objects that specifically do a certain task, e.g., a certain complicated calculation. Those non-UI objects are unit-tested, but also need access to lots of those global settings. The way we've implemented this right now, is by giving the objects properties that are filled by the Application Controller at runtime. When testing, we create the objects in the test and fill in values for testing (not from the database).</p>

<p>This works better, in any case much better than having all those objects need some global <em>Settings</em> object --- that of course effectively makes unit testing impossible :) Disadvantage can be that you sometimes need to set a dozen of properties, or that you need to let those properties 'percolate' into sub-objects.</p>

<p><strong>So the general question is</strong>: how do you provide access to global application settings in your projects, without the need for global variables, while still being able to unit test your code? This must be a problem that's been solved 100's of times...</p>

Summer (5-1 to 8-31) 
Spring  (3-1 to 4-30) 
Fall (9-1 to 10-31)
Winter (11-1 to 2-28) </p>

Winter: Mondays only
Spring: Tues, Thurs, Sat
Summer: Any Day
Fall: Tues, Thurs, Sat</p>

<p>If I was writing this in PHP I would use arrays like this:</p>

<pre><code>//M=Monday,t=Tuesday,T=Thursday.... etc
$schedule[""A""][""Winter""]='M';
$schedule[""A""][""Spring""]='tTS';
$schedule[""A""][""Summer""]='Any';
$schedule[""A""][""Fall""]='tTS';
$schedule[""B""][""Winter""]='t';
</code></pre>

<p>I COULD make the days arrays (array(""Tuesday"",""Thursday"",""Saturday"")) etc, but it is not necessary for what I'm really trying to accomplish.</p>

$seasons[""Summer""][""end""]=0801;

I felt that this tool didn't give me confidence and I thought that later in the project I could not manage it due to its forced established rules of development. And also a lot of things like sending emails, using my own controls, and other things had their complication, it seemed that at some point it was not going to be as easy as initially I thought and as initially the product claims.

Most of our other projects up to this point make use of stored procedures for such things. However, I'd like to leverage LINQ-to-SQL if it makes more sense.</p>

160,15310,1644,2008-08-18T22:19:16Z,,3,Optimizing the PDF Export of Huge Reports in Sql Reporting Services 2005,"<p>First off I understand that it is a horrible idea to run extremely large/long running reports. I am aware that Microsoft has a rule of thumb stating that a SSRS report should take no longer than 30 seconds to execute.  However sometimes gargantuan reports are a preferred evil due to external forces such complying with state laws.</p>

<p>At my place of employment, we have an asp.net (2.0) app that we have migrated from Crystal Reports to SSRS. Due to the large user base and complex reporting UI requirements we have a set of screens that accepts user inputted parameters and creates schedules to be run over night. Since the application supports multiple reporting frameworks we do not use the scheduling/snapshot facilities of SSRS. All of the reports in the system are generated by a scheduled console app which takes user entered parameters and generates the reports with the corresponding reporting solutions the reports were created with. In the case of SSRS reports, the console app generates the SSRS reports and exports them as PDFs via the SSRS web service API. </p>

<p>So far SSRS has been much easier to deal with than Crystal with the exception of a certain 25,000 page report that we have recently converted from crystal reports to SSRS. The SSRS server is a 64bit 2003 server with 32 gigs of ram running SSRS 2005. All of our smaller reports work fantastically, but we are having trouble with our larger reports such as this one.  Unfortunately, we can't seem to generate the aforemention report through the web service API. The following error occurs roughly 30-35 minutes into the generation/export:</p>

<p>Exception Message: The underlying connection was closed: An unexpected error occurred on a receive.</p>

<p>The web service call is something I'm sure you all have seen before:  </p>

<pre><code>data = rs.Render(this.ReportPath, this.ExportFormat, null, deviceInfo,
   selectedParameters, null, null, out encoding, out mimeType, out usedParameters, 
   out warnings, out streamIds);
</code></pre>

<p>The odd thing is that this report will run/render/export if the report is run directly on the reporting server using the report manager. The proc that produces the data for the report runs for about 5 minutes. The report renders in SSRS native format in the browser/viewer after about 12 minutes. Exporting to pdf through the browser/viewer in the report manager takes an additional 55 minutes. This works reliably and it produces a whopping 1.03gb pdf.</p>

<p>Here are some of the more obvious things I've tried to get the report working via the web service API:  </p>

<ul>
<li>set the HttpRuntime ExecutionTimeout
value to 3 hours on the report
server</li>
<li>disabled http keep alives on the report server</li>
<li>increased the script timeout on the report server</li>
<li>set the report to never time out on the server</li>
<li>set the report timeout to several hours on the client call  </li>
</ul>

<p>From the tweaks I have tried, I am fairly comfortable saying that any timeout issues have been eliminated. </p>

<p>Based off of my research of the error message, I believe that the web service API does not send chunked responses by default. This means that it tries to send all 1.3gb over the wire in one response. At a certain point, IIS throws in the towel. Unfortunately the API abstracts away web service configuration so I can't seem to find a way to enable response chunking. </p>

<ol>
<li>Does anyone know of anyway to reduce/optimize the PDF export phase and or the size of the PDF without lowering the total page count?</li>
<li>Is there a way to turn on response chunking for SSRS?</li>
<li>Does anyone else have any other theories as to why this runs on the server but not through the API?</li>
</ol>

<p>EDIT: After reading kcrumley's post I began to take a look at the average page size by taking file size / page count. Interestingly enough on smaller reports the math works out so that each page is roughly 5K. Interestingly, when the report gets larger this ""average"" increases. An 8000 page report for example is averaging over 40K/page. Very odd. I will also add that the number of records per page is set except for the last page in each grouping, so it's not a case where some pages have more records than another. </p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

<hr>

<p>dp: You are right that I missed a check in Equals, I have updated it.  Using the existing hashcode from the byte array will result in reference equality (or at least that same concept translated to hashcodes).
for example:</p>

<pre><code>byte[] b1 = new byte[] { 1 };
byte[] b2 = new byte[] { 1 };
int h1 = b1.GetHashCode();
int h2 = b2.GetHashCode();
</code></pre>

<p>With that code, despite the two byte arrays having the same values within them, they are referring to different parts of memory and will result in (probably) different hash codes. I need the hash codes for two byte arrays with the same contents to be equal.</p>

To be proficient, you have to decide which areas to focus your learning and understanding. Certain skill sets synergize with each other, like data-driven web development and SQL experience. However, all the win32 API experience in the world may not directly apply to linux development. This leads me to believe, as a beginning programmer, I should start deciding where I want to specialize after I have general understanding of the basic principles of software development. </p>

<p>This is a multi-part question really: </p>

<ol>
<li>What are the common specializations within computer programming and software development?  </li>
<li>Which of these specializations have more long-term value, both as a foundation for other specializations and/or as marketable skills? </li>
<li>Which skill sets complement each other? </li>
<li>Are there any areas of specialization that hinder your ability of developing other areas of specialization.</li>

<p>When I wanted to use it yesterday, I was puzzled to find out that Intellisense didn't show the function (nor <code>VerifyAccess()</code>, which throws an exception when not on the UI thread), even though the MSDN library lists it. I decided to investigate the class using Reflector. It seems that the function in question has an <code>EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)</code> attribute attached to it. The <code>Dispatcher</code> class, which is used by <code>DispatcherObject</code>, has the same attribute attached to <code>CheckAccess()</code> and <code>VerifyAccess()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class DispatcherObject
{
    // ...

    [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]
    public bool CheckAccess();
    [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]
    public void VerifyAccess();

    // ...

    [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Advanced)]
    public Dispatcher Dispatcher { get; }
}


public sealed class Dispatcher

    [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]
    public bool CheckAccess();
    [EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]
    public void VerifyAccess();

    // ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>I don't believe that the application of that attribute is random (or a joke), so my question is: why is it there? Should those methods not be called directly? Then why aren't they <code>protected</code> (or <code>internal</code>, like some of the most useful methods in the WPF)?</p>

<p>The problem is that CryptEncrypt can produce NULL's in the output, meaning that when it's stored in the database, the string manipulations will at some point truncate the ciphertext.</p>

<p>Ideally we'd like to use an algo that will produce cyphertext that doesn't contain NULLs as that will cause the least amount of change to the existing databases (changing a column from string to binary and code to deal with binary instead of strings) and just decrypt existing data and re-encrypt with the new algo at database upgrade time.</p>

<p>The algorithm doesn't need to be the most secure, as the database is already in a reasonably secure environment (not an open network / teh interwebs) but does need to bebetter than ROT13 (which I can almost decrypt in my head now!)</p>

<li>If filename is in the format <code>Show Name - [01x23].avi</code> display it a 'missing episode name' section of the output</li>
<li>The path should be in the format <code>Show Name/season 2/the_file.avi</code> (where season 2 should be the correct season number in the filename)</li>

<p>One is an HFS+ volume which I use for TimeMachine backups.
The other, an NTFS volume that I use for general file copying etc on Mac and Windows boxes.</p>

<p>So what happens is that whenever I plug in the disk into my Mac USB, OSX goes off and mounts both volumes and shows an icon on the desktop for each. The thing is that to remove the disk you have to eject the volume and in this case do it for both volumes, which causes an annoying warning dialog to be shown every time. </p>

<p>What I'd prefer is some way to prevent the NTFS volume from auto-mounting altogether. I've done some hefty googling and here's a list of things I've tried so far:</p>

<ul>

<li>I've tried setting AutoMount to No in /etc/hostconfig but that is a bit too global for my liking.</li>

However I would be interested in advice about when to use one or the other (or neither possibly).<br>
The <a href=""http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/textsearch-indexes.html"">PostgreSQL documentation</a> has some information about this:</p>

<ul>
<li>GIN index lookups are about three times faster than GiST</li>

<li>GIN indexes are about ten times slower to update than GiST</li>
<li>GIN indexes are two-to-three times larger than GiST</li>
</ul>

<p>However I would be particularly interested to know if there is a performance impact when the memory to index size ration starts getting small (ie. the index size becomes much bigger than the available memory)? I've been told on the #postgresql IRC channel that GIN needs to keep all the index in memory, otherwise it won't be effective, because, unlike B-Tree, it doesn't know which part to read in from disk for a particular query? The question would be: is this true (because I've also been told the opposite of this)? Does GiST have the same restrictions? Are there other restrictions I should be aware of while using one of these indexing algorithms?</p>

<p>I need to use push-technology with WCF through client firewalls. This must be a common problem, and I know for a fact it works in theory (see links below), but I have failed to get it working, and I haven't been able to find a code sample that demonstrates it.</p>

<p>Requirements: </p>

<ul>
<li>WCF</li>
<li>Clients connects to server through tcp port 80 (netTcpBinding).</li>
<li>Server pushes back information at irregular intervals (1 min to several hours).</li>
<li>Users should not have to configure their firewalls, server pushes must pass through firewalls that have all inbound ports closed. TCP duplex on the same connection is needed for this, a dual binding does not work since a port has to be opened on the client firewall.</li>
<li>Clients sends heartbeats to server at regular intervals (perhaps every 15 mins) so server knows client is still alive.</li>
<li>Server is IIS7 with WAS.</li>
</ul>

<p>The solution seems to be duplex netTcpBinding. Based on this information:</p>

My current solution, which sucks, is to send the datetimes into a UDF to convert them to midnight of the same day, and then check those dates for equality.  When it comes to the query plan, this is a disaster, as are almost all UDFs in joins or where clauses.  This is one of the only places in my application that I haven't been able to root out the functions and give the query optimizer something it can actually use to locate the best index.</p>

<p>In this case, merging the function code back into the query seems impractical.</p>

<p>I think I am missing something simple here.</p>

<p>Here's the function for reference.</p>

<pre><code>if not exists (select * from dbo.sysobjects 
              where id = object_id(N'dbo.f_MakeDate') and               
              type in (N'FN', N'IF', N'TF', N'FS', N'FT'))
  exec('create function dbo.f_MakeDate() returns int as 
         begin declare @retval int return @retval end')
go

alter function dbo.f_MakeDate
(
    @Day datetime, 
    @Hour int, 
    @Minute int
)
returns datetime
as

/*

Creates a datetime using the year-month-day portion of @Day, and the 
@Hour and @Minute provided

*/

begin

declare @retval datetime
set @retval = cast(
    cast(datepart(m, @Day) as varchar(2)) + 
    '/' + 
    cast(datepart(d, @Day) as varchar(2)) + 
    '/' + 
    cast(datepart(yyyy, @Day) as varchar(4)) + 
    ' ' + 
    cast(@Hour as varchar(2)) + 
    ':' + 
    cast(@Minute as varchar(2)) as datetime)
return @retval
end

go
</code></pre>

<p>To complicate matters, I am joining on time zone tables to check the date against the local time, which could be different for every row:</p>

<pre><code>where 
dbo.f_MakeDate(dateadd(hh, tz.Offset + 
    case when ds.LocalTimeZone is not null 
    then 1 else 0 end, t.TheDateINeedToCheck), 0, 0) = @activityDateMidnight
</code></pre>

<p>[Edit]</p>

<p>I'm incorporating @Todd's suggestion:</p>

<pre><code>where datediff(day, dateadd(hh, tz.Offset + 
    case when ds.LocalTimeZone is not null 
    then 1 else 0 end, t.TheDateINeedToCheck), @ActivityDate) = 0
</code></pre>

<p>My misconception about how datediff works (the same day of year in consecutive years yields 366, not 0 as I expected) caused me to waste a lot of effort.</p>

<p>But the query plan didn't change.  I think I need to go back to the drawing board with the whole thing.</p>

I ""care about"" dimension 0 only, and ""don't care"" about the rest (dim 1).
Summing this array with the above specifications will
""collapse"" the ""stacks"" of dimension 1 down to a single 4 x 1 array:

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

Many of my posts regard implementing a genetic algorithm (This post, sparsearray, rank an array, pointer manipulation).</li>
<li>I am using a sparse array representation, as it is possible to exceed the number of molecules in the universe using a traditional (dense) array.  For now, the implementation of the sparsearray itself doesnt matter a whole lot, as I am working to make it work with a standard array before going to a sparse representation.  For those who havent seen my previous questions, I am using a binary search tree as the structure to contain the sparse array points, and a ""driver"" function to traverse the tree as necessary, returning whatever the function is designed to do.  This is flexible, so I can accomodate a lot of different methods of accessing the array. </li>

One of the applications that I frequently use and develop for could really benefit from a more comprehensive way of tracking how records have changed over time. For instance, right now records can have a number of timestamp and modified user fields, but we currently don't have a scheme for logging multiple change, for instance if an operation is rolled back. In a perfect world, it would be possible to reconstruct the record as it was after each save, etc.</p>

<p>Some info on the DB:</p>

<ul>
<li>Needs to have the capacity to grow by thousands of records per week</li>
<li>50-60 Tables</li>
<li>Main revisioned tables may have several million records each</li>
<li>Reasonable amount of foreign keys and indexes set</li>
<li>Using PostgreSQL 8.x</li>

<p>I am already using the SqlClient.SqlBulkCopy (which is based on TDS) to speed up the data transfer across the wire which helped a lot, but I'm still looking for more.</p>

<p>I have a simple table that looks like this: </p>

<pre><code> CREATE TABLE [BulkData](
 [ContainerId] [int] NOT NULL,
 [BinId] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [Sequence] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [ItemId] [int] NOT NULL,
 [Left] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [Top] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [Right] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 [Bottom] [smallint] NOT NULL,
 CONSTRAINT [PKBulkData] PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED 
 (
  [ContainerIdId] ASC,
  [BinId] ASC,
  [Sequence] ASC
))
</code></pre>

<p>I'm inserting data in chunks that average about 300 rows where ContainerId and BinId are constant in each chunk and the Sequence value is 0-n and the values are pre-sorted based on the primary key.  </p>

<p>The %Disk time performance counter spends a lot of time at 100% so it is clear that disk IO is the main issue but the speeds I'm getting are several orders of magnitude below a raw file copy.</p>

<p>Does it help any if I:</p>

<ol>
<li>Drop the Primary key while I am doing the inserting and recreate it later</li>
<li>Do inserts into a temporary table with the same schema and periodically transfer them into the main table to keep the size of the table where insertions are happening small</li>
<li>Anything else?</li>
</ol>

<p>--
Based on the responses I have gotten, let me clarify a little bit:</p>

<p>Portman: I'm using a clustered index because when the data is all imported I will need to access data sequentially in that order.  I don't particularly need the index to be there while importing the data.  Is there any advantage to having a nonclustered PK index while doing the inserts as opposed to dropping the constraint entirely for import?</p>

<p>Chopeen:  The data is being generated remotely on many other machines (my SQL server can only handle about 10 currently, but I would love to be able to add more).  It's not practical to run the entire process on the local machine because it would then have to process 50 times as much input data to generate the output.</p>

<p>Jason: I am not doing any concurrent queries against the table during the import process, I will try dropping the primary key and see if that helps.</p>

248,24270,2131,2008-08-23T14:40:28Z,,126,What's the point of OOP?,"<p>As far as I can tell, in spite of the countless millions or billions spent on OOP education, languages, and tools, OOP has not improved developer productivity or software reliability, nor has it reduced development costs. Few people use OOP in any rigorous sense (few people adhere to or understand principles such as LSP); there seems to be little uniformity or consistency to the approaches that people take to modelling problem domains.  All too often, the class is used simply for its syntactic sugar; it puts the functions for a record type into their own little namespace.</p>

<p>I've written a large amount of code for a wide variety of applications. Although there have been places where true substitutable subtyping played a valuable role in the application, these have been pretty exceptional. In general, though much lip service is given to talk of ""re-use"" the reality is that unless a piece of code does <em>exactly</em> what you want it to do, there's very little cost-effective ""re-use"".  It's extremely hard to design classes to be extensible <em>in the right way</em>, and so the cost of extension is normally so great that ""re-use"" simply isn't worthwhile.</p>

<p>In many regards, this doesn't surprise me.  The real world isn't ""OO"", and the idea implicit in OO--that we can model things with some class taxonomy--seems to me very fundamentally flawed (I can sit on a table, a tree stump, a car bonnet, someone's lap--but not one of those is-a chair).  Even if we move to more abstract domains, OO modelling is often difficult, counterintuitive, and ultimately unhelpful (consider the classic examples of circles/ellipses or squares/rectangles).</p>

<p>So what am I missing here? Where's the value of OOP, and why has all the time and money failed to make software any better?</p>

<p>I. <strong>Hate</strong>. CSS.</p>

<p>It is a never-ending nightmare. Every minor layout change feels like a hack. Solutions to problems seem to often involve jiggering numbers around like some chef trying to work out exactly how much nutmeg to put in his soon-to-be famous rice pudding. Then comes the multiple browser issue, the multiple resolution issues..</p>

<p>.. to cut a long story short, it's a pain. A PITA, if you will.</p>

<p>Many frameworks seek to abstract away from HTML (custom tags, JSFs component system) in an effort to make dealing with that particular kettle of fish easier.</p>

<p>Is there anything you folks have used that has a similar concept applied to CSS? Something that does a bunch of cross-browser magic for you, supports like variables (why do I have to type #3c5c8d every time I want that colour), supports caclulated fields (which are 'compiled' into CSS and JS), etc.</p>

<p>Alternatively, am I even thinking about this correctly? Am I trying to push a very square block through a very round hole? </p>

<p>The best approach I've found so far is to write a script to parse the nearly-valid xml output (the comments are invalid and many characters are escaped in varying ways, Ã© becomes [[[e9]]]Ã©, $ becomes \$, % becomes \%...) of the command-line pdftoipe utility (to convert pdf files for a program called <a href=""http://tclab.kaist.ac.kr/ipe/"" rel=""nofollow"">ipe</a>), which gives me text elements with their positions on each page [see sample below], which works well enough for reports where the same values are on the same place on every page I care about, but would require extra scripting effort for importing matrix [cross-tab] pdf files. pdftoipe is not at all intended for this, and at best can be compiled manually using cygwin for windows.</p>

<li>how to set it up in the calling application</li>
</ul>

<p>Do you know the uber tutorial that we should link to?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Glenn Slaven pointed me in the right direction. Add this to your App.config/Web.config inside <code>&lt;configuration/&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;system.diagnostics&gt;
    &lt;trace autoflush=""true""&gt;

<p>This will add a <code>TextWriterTraceListener</code> that will catch everything you send to with <code>Trace.WriteLine</code> etc.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> @DanEsparza pointed out that you should use <code>Trace.TraceInformation</code>, <code>Trace.TraceWarning</code> and <code>Trace.TraceError</code> instead of <code>Trace.WriteLine</code>, as they allow you to format messages the same way as <code>string.Format</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you don't add any listeners, then you can still see the trace output with the SysInternals program DebugView (<code>Dbgview.exe</code>): <a href=""http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896647.aspx"">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896647.aspx</a></p>

<p>My question is - <strong>what would be the best approach to perhaps moving to the Qt framework</strong>?  Does Qt play nice with MFC?  Would it be better to start porting some of our custom controls to Qt and gradually integrate more and more into our existing MFC apps? (is this possible?).</p>

<p>Any advice or previous experience is appreciated.</p>

<p>I'd like to add a scalar function to my script that gets the next available ID (i.e. last used ID + 1) but I'm not sure this is possible because there doesn't seem to be a way to use a global or static variable from within a UDF, I can't use a temp table, and I can't update a permanent table from within a function. </p>

<p>Currently my script looks like this: </p>

<pre>
   declare @v_baseID int 
   exec dbo.getNextID @v_baseID out  --sproc to get the next available id
   --Lots of these - where n is a hardcoded value
   insert into tableOfStuff (someStuff, uniqueID) values ('stuff', @v_baseID + n ) 
   exec dbo.UpdateNextID @v_baseID + lastUsedn  --sproc to update the last used id

<pre>
   --Lots of these
   insert into tableOfStuff (someStuff, uniqueID) values ('stuff', getNextID() ) 
</pre>

<p>Hardcoding the offset is a pain in the arse, and is error prone.  Packaging it up into a simple scalar function is very appealing, but I'm starting to think it can't be done that way since there doesn't seem to be a way to maintain the offset counter between calls.  Is that right, or is there something I'm missing.  </p>

<p>Two users hitting it won't happen.  This is an upgrade script that will be run only once, and never concurrently. </p>

<p>The actual sproc isn't prefixed with sp_, fixed the example code. </p>

<p>In normal usage, we do use an id table and a sproc to get IDs as needed, I was just looking for a cleaner way to do it in this script, which essentially just dumps a bunch of data into the db. </p>

However, if I want to verify that the code in fact returns one list item per one database row, I'm writing test code that looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Expect.Call(reader.Read()).Return(true);
Expect.Call(reader[""foo_id""]).Return((long) 1);
// ....
Expect.Call(reader.Read()).Return(true);
Expect.Call(reader[""foo_id""]).Return((long) 2);
// ....
Expect.Call(reader.Read()).Return(false);
</code></pre>

<p>Which is rather tedious and rather easily broken, too. </p>

<p>How should I be approaching this issue so that the result won't be a huge mess of brittle tests?</p>

<p>Btw I'm currently using Rhino.Mocks for this, but I can change it if the result is convincing enough. Just as long as the alternative isn't TypeMock, because their EULA was a bit too scary for my tastes last I checked.</p>

        throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Invalid argument for xProjection"");
    }
    return (p2.x - p1.x) * 1.5;
}

public double xProjection(Point p1, Point p2) {
    assert p1 != null : ""p1 should not be null"";
    assert p2 != null : ""p2 should not be null"";

<p>I prefer the <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/lang/assert.html"">assertions</a> approach, but I don't like the fact that assertions are turned off by default.</p>

<p>The book finally states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In most programming languages there is no good way to deal with a null that is passed by a caller accidentally. Because this is the case, the rational approach is to forbid passing null by default.</p>

I am designing a software application in my <code>&lt;sarcasm&gt;</code><em>voluminous</em><code>&lt;/sarcasm&gt;</code> spare time.  I would like it to be both cross-platform and modular.  At this point, because I am still in the planning phase, I can pick practically any language and toolset.</p>

<p>This makes things harder, not easier, because there are seemingly so many ways of accomplishing both of the goals (modularity, platform agnosticism). </p>

<p>My basic premise is that security, data storage, interaction with the operating system, and configuration should all be handled by a ""container"" application - but most of the other functionality will be supplied through plug-in modules.  If I had to describe it at a high level (without completely giving away my idea), it would be a single application that can do many different jobs, all dedicated to the same goal (there are lots of disparate things to do, but all the data has to interact and be highly available).</p>

<p>This is not a new idea, and not particularly exotic.  Yet I find myself wrestling with not so much how to do it (I can think of lots of ways), but which method is best.</p>

<p>For example, I know that Eclipse practically embodies what I am describing, but I find Java applications in general (and Eclipse is no exception) to be too large and slow for what I need. Ditto desktop apps written Python and Ruby (which are excellent languages!)  </p>

<li><p>I'm directly calling the category and cost properties of the data provider. The names are actually configurable when setting up the chart, I'd like to maintain that flexibility.</p></li>
<li><p>The default data tip would show the category, the cost (without a dollar sign), and the percentage it makes up in the pie chart. So here, I've lost the percentage. I just have no idea which property of what would hold that. It might be part of the series.</p></li>
<li><p>I probably only need to override the <code>dataItemRenderer</code> for the cost part of the series, but I don't know how to access it.  The documentation is a little ... lacking there.</p></li>

Nor does <code>document.forms[0].submit()</code>.  The only way to get the onsubmit code generated in the form_remote_tag to execute is to create a hidden submit button, and invoke the click method on the button from the select tag.  Here's a working ERb partial example.</p>

  &lt;% end %&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So, is there any way to remove the invisible submit button for this use case?</p>

<p>There seems to be some confusion.  So, let me explain.  The basic problem is that <code>submit()</code> doesn't call the <code>onsubmit()</code> code rendered into the form.</p>

<p>The actual HTML form that Rails renders from this ERb looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=""/products/1"" method=""post"" onsubmit=""new Ajax.Updater('content', '/products/1', {asynchronous:true, evalScripts:true, method:'get', parameters:Form.serialize(this)}); return false;""&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id=""content""&gt;
    &lt;select id=""update"" name=""update"" onchange=""this.form.commit.click""&gt;
      &lt;option value=""1""&gt;foo&lt;/option&gt;
      &lt;option value=""2""&gt;bar&lt;/option&gt;

    &lt;input name=""commit"" style=""display: none"" type=""submit"" value=""submit_button"" /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I want to axe the invisible submit button, but using a straight form.submit appears to not work.  So, I need some way to call the form's onsubmit event code.</p>

<p>Update: Orion Edwards solution would work if there wasn't a <code>return(false);</code> generated by Rails.  I'm not sure which is worse though, sending a phantom click to an invisible submit button or calling eval on the <code>getAttribute('onsubmit')</code> call after removing the return call with a javascript string replacement!   </p>

The rule of this hierarchy is that every CustID has a ParentID and if the CustID has no parent then the ParentID = CustID and it is the highest level.</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @LookupID int

--Our test value
SET @LookupID = 1

WITH cteLevelOne (ParentID, CustID) AS
(
    	SELECT   a.ParentID, a.CustID
    	FROM     tblCustomer AS a
    	WHERE    a.CustID = @LookupID
    UNION ALL
    	SELECT   a.ParentID, a.CustID
    	FROM     tblCustomer AS a
    	INNER JOIN cteLevelOne AS c ON a.CustID = c.ParentID
    	WHERE c.CustID &lt;&gt; a.CustomerID
)

1            8
5            4

<p>What I want is just the last row of that result:  </p>

<pre><code>ParentID    CustID
5            5
</code></pre>

<p>How do I just return the last record generated in the CTE (which would be highest level CustID)?</p>

<p>Also note that there are multiple unrelated CustID hierarchies in this table so I can't just do a SELECT * FROM tblCustomer WHERE ParentID = CustID. I can't order by ParentID or CustID because the ID number is not related to where it is in the hierarchy.</p>

purge_object_index_every says that it clears the index every n requests.  Setting this to ""1"" or ""0"", seems to clear the index... sometimes.  I'd expect one of those two to work, but for some reason it doesn't do it every time.  More like 1 in 5 times.</p>

<pre>
#light
let ListProduct l = List.fold_left (*) 1 l
</pre>

<p>Which inputs a list of ints and multiplies each element in the list, i.e. obtains the product of the list (e.g. a list of 1,2,3 would be calculated as 1*2*3=6). The closest C# equivilent, using LINQ and functional concepts is as follows:-</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;

...

public static class ListHelper {
  public static int ListProduct(List&lt;int&gt; l) {
    return l.Aggregate(1, (i, j) =&gt; i * j);
  }
}

using System.Collections.Generic;

public static class ListHelper {
  public static int ListProduct(List&lt;int&gt; l) {
    int ret = 1;

    return ret;
  }
}

Whenever I do /etc/init.d/yaws restart or a stop/start, it initializes according to an old version of the config file (/etc/yaws/yaws.conf).</p>

<p>I know this because I changed the docroot from the default to another directory (call it A), then a few weeks later changed it to directory B, and the config file has stayed with B for the last several months.  But then, after a restart, it switches back to A.  If it switched back to the package default, that would be understandable, but it switches to an old customized version instead.</p>

<p>The funny thing is that if I leave it stopped for several minutes, when I start it again, everything switches back to normal (using directory B).  But while it's stopped, if I run ps, I don't see any yaws-related processes (yaws, heart, etc).  This problem has survived several reboots, so it's got to be an old cached copy of the config somewhere, but I have yet to find anything like that.</p>

<p>The complete interface to this COM component corresponds to a software standard used in the chemical process industry (CAPE-OPEN) and as a result this COM component is supposed to be usable by a range of 3rd party executables that are out of my control.</p>

<p>My component works as expected in many of these EXEs, but for one in particular the Edit() method just hangs without the dialog appearing.</p>

<p>However, if I make a call to <code>::MessageBox()</code> immediately before <code>DoModal()</code> the dialog displays and behaves correctly after first showing the MessageBox.</p>

<p>I have a suspicion that the problem may be something to do with this particular EXE running as a 'hidden window application'.</p>

<p>I have tried using both NULL and the return value from <code>::GetConsoleWindow()</code> as the dialog's parent, neither have worked.</p>

<p>The dialog itself is an ATL/WTL CPropertySheetImpl.</p>

<p>You get a screenful of stackoverflow questions by requesting <code>/questions ?sort=newest</code> page. Next page link leads to <code>/questions?page=2 &amp;sort=newest</code>. I suppose that at server side, the request is translated into an SQL query with LIMIT clause. Problem with this approach is, that if new question were added while user browses first page, his second page will start with some questions he already saw. (If he has 10 question per page, and 10 new questions happened to be added, heâll get exactly the same content second time!)</p>

I've been looking at a few PHP framework recently, and it came down to two. The Zend Framework or CodeIgniter. </p>

<p>I prefer CodeIgniter, because of its simple design. It's very bare bone, and it is just kept simple. The thing I don't like though is the weak template system. The template system is important for me, because I will be working with another designer. Being able to give him a good template system is a big plus.</p>

<p>Zend was the second choice, because of the better template system that is built in. Zend is a different beast though compared to CodeIgniter. It emphasis ""loose coupling between modules"", but is a bigger framework. I don't like to feel like I have many things running under the hood that I never use. That is unnecessary overhead in my opinion, so I thought about putting a template system into CodeIgniter: Smarty.</p>

<p><strong>Question(s)</strong>: How easy/hard is the process to integrate Smarty into CodeIgniter? From my initial scan of the CodeIgniter documentation, I can see that the layout of the framework is easy enough to understand, and I anticipate no problems. I want to know if anyone has used it before, and therefore are aware of any ""gotchas"" you my have experienced that is going to make this harder than it should be or impossible to pull off. I also want to know if this is a good thing to do at all. Is the template system in CodeIgniter enough for normal use? Are there any other template modules that are good for CodeIgniter aside from Smarty? I better off with Zend Framework? Is any wheel being invented here? Thank you for your help! </p>

So, for now, I've modified the automated regression test to not register a failure--it's deliberately allowing this bad behavior to go by, I mean.  </p>

<p>So, I am interested in the opinions of others on this site.  Obviously, I'll add a bug to our defect tracking to make sure this error behavior gets fixed.  But are there any compelling reasons (either way) to either change the regression test to constantly indicate failure or leave the regression test broken and not have a failure until we can get to fixing the defective behavior?

<p>I'm a little concerned about repeated failures from known causes eventually getting treated like warnings in C++.  I know developers who see warnings in their C++ code and simply ignore them because they think they're just useless noise.

<p>If I open up the solution in the branch and remove the dead projects and try to re-add them (by right-clicking sln, add existing project, choose project located in the branch folder, it gives me the error...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Cannot load the project c:\sandbox\my_solution\proj1\proj1.csproj, the file has been removed or deleted.  The project path I was trying to add is this:  c:\sandbox\my_solution\branches\experimental-upgrade\proj1\proj1.csproj</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What in the world is pointing these projects <em>outside</em> of their local root?  The solution file is identical to the one in the dev branch, and those projects load just fine.  I also looked at the vspscc and vssscc files but didn't find anything.</p>

<p>Ideas?</p>

His main reason was that views made it too easy for a thoughtless coder to needlessly involve joined tables which, if that coder tried harder, could be avoided altogether.  Implicitly he was encouraging code reuse via copy-and-paste instead of encapsulation in views.</p>

<p>The database had nearly 600 tables and was highly normalised, so most of the useful SQL was necessarily verbose.</p>

<p>Several years later I can see at least one bad outcome from the ban - we have many hundreds of dense, lengthy stored procs that verge on unmaintainable.</p>

<p>But sometimes I really get stymied by the logic behind <code>session.Flush</code>. I have seen examples where you have a <code>session.SaveOrUpdate()</code> followed by a flush, but when I remove Flush it works fine anyway. Sometimes I run into errors on the Flush statement saying that the session timed out, and removing it made sure that I didn't run into that error.</p>

<p>Anyone any ideas?</p>

<p>Both mp3split and ffmpeg are both good solutions.

Here's some more good command line parameters for generating previews with ffmpeg</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>-t &lt;seconds&gt;</code></strong> chop after specified number of seconds</li>
<li><strong><code>-y</code></strong> force file overwrite</li>
<li><strong><code>-ab &lt;bitrate&gt;</code></strong> set bitrate e.g. <em>-ab 96k</em></li>
<li><strong><code>-ar &lt;rate Hz&gt;</code></strong> set sampling rate e.g. <em>-ar 22050</em> for 22.05kHz</li>
<li><strong><code>-map_meta_data &lt;outfile&gt;:&lt;infile&gt;</code></strong> copy track metadata from infile to outfile</li>

<p>instead of setting -ab and -ar, you can copy the original track settings, as Tim Farley suggests, with:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><code>-acodec copy</code></strong></li>

/// This class's FirstProperty property
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
[DefaultValue(""myValue"")]
public string FirstProperty {
    get {
        return Dictionary[""myKey""];
    }
    set {
        Dictionary[""myKey""] = value;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This is probably the typical way of doing it. It's fairly efficient, easy to understand, etc. The only disadvantage is with a longer or more complex key it would be possible to misspell it or change only one instance or something, leading me to this:</p>

<pre><code>/// &lt;summary&gt;
/// This class's SecondProperty property
/// &lt;/summary&gt;
[DefaultValue(""myValue"")]
private const string DICT_MYKEY = ""myKey""
public string SecondProperty {
    get {
        return Dictionary[DICT_MYKEY];
    }
    set {
        Dictionary[DICT_MYKEY] = value;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Which is marginally more complicated, but seems to offer additional safety, and is closer to what I would think of as the ""Code Complete"" solution. The downside is that when you also have a ///  block and a [DefaultValue()] block above the property already, it starts getting a bit crowded up there.</p>

<p>So which do you like better, and why? Does anybody have any better ideas?</p>

515,46030,1358,2008-09-05T15:25:11Z,,20,C# Force Form Focus,"<p>So, I did search google and SO prior to asking this question. Basically I have a DLL that has a form compiled into it. The form will be used to display information to the screen. Eventually it will be asynchronous and expose a lot of customization in the dll. For now I just want it to display properly. The problem that I am having is that I use the dll by loading it in a Powershell session. So when I try to display the form and get it to come to the top and have focus, It has no problem with displaying over all the other apps, but I can't for the life of me get it to display over the Powershell window. Here is the code that I am currently using to try and get it to display. I am sure that the majority of it won't be required once I figure it out, this just represents all the things that I found via google.</p>

<pre><code>CLass Blah
{
        [DllImport(""user32.dll"", EntryPoint = ""SystemParametersInfo"")]
        public static extern bool SystemParametersInfo(uint uiAction, uint uiParam, uint pvParam, uint fWinIni);

        [DllImport(""user32.dll"", EntryPoint = ""SetForegroundWindow"")]
        public static extern bool SetForegroundWindow(IntPtr hWnd);

        [DllImport(""User32.dll"", EntryPoint = ""ShowWindowAsync"")]
        private static extern bool ShowWindowAsync(IntPtr hWnd, int cmdShow);
        private const int WS_SHOWNORMAL = 1;

    public void ShowMessage(string msg)
    {
            MessageForm msgFrm = new MessageForm();
            msgFrm.lblMessage.Text = ""FOO"";
            msgFrm.ShowDialog();
            msgFrm.BringToFront();
            msgFrm.TopMost = true;
            msgFrm.Activate();

            SystemParametersInfo((uint)0x2001, 0, 0, 0x0002 | 0x0001);
            ShowWindowAsync(msgFrm.Handle, WS_SHOWNORMAL);
            SetForegroundWindow(msgFrm.Handle);
            SystemParametersInfo((uint)0x2001, 200000, 200000, 0x0002 | 0x0001);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As I say I'm sure that most of that is either not needed or even flat out wrong, I just wanted to show the things that I had tried. Also, as I mentioned, I plan to have this be asynchronously displayed at some point which I suspect will wind up requiring a separate thread. Would splitting the form out into it's own thread make it easier to cause it to get focus over the Powershell session? </p>

<hr>

<p>@Joel, thanks for the info. Here is what I tried based on your suggestion:</p>

<pre><code>msgFrm.ShowDialog();
msgFrm.BringToFront();
msgFrm.Focus();
Application.DoEvents();
</code></pre>

<p>The form still comes up <em>under</em> the Powershell session. I'll proceed with working out the threading. I've spawned threads before but never where the parent thread needed to talk to the child thread, so we'll see how it goes.</p>

<p>Thnks for all the ideas so far folks.</p>

<hr>

<p>Ok, threading it took care of the problem. @Quarrelsome, I did try both of those. Neither (nor both together) worked. I am curious as to what is evil about using threading? I am not using Application.Run and I have yet to have a problem. I am using a mediator class that both the parent thread and the child thread have access to. In that object I am using a ReaderWriterLock to lock one property that represents the message that I want displayed on the form that the child thread creates. The parent locks the property then writes what should be displayed. The child thread locks the property and reads what it should change the label on the form to. The child has to do this on a polling interval (I default it to 500ms) which I'm not real happy about, but I could not find an event driven way to let the child thread know that the proerty had changed, so I'm stuck with polling.</p>

For every request, I get back (among other things) a list of which routes serve the stop in question.

<p>I have a many-to-many relationship set up between Route and Stop, and I want to dynamically check and update these associations on every request. There is no ""master list"" of which routes serve which stops, so this seems like the best way to get this data.</p>

<p>I believe that the way I'm doing it now is very inefficient:</p>

<pre><code># routes is an array of [number, destination] that I build while iterating over the data
routes.uniq.each do |route|
  number      = route[0]
  destination = route[1]

  r = Route.find_by_number_and_destination(number, destination)

  if !r
    r = Route.new :number =&gt; number, :destination =&gt; destination
    r.save
  end

  # I have to check if it already exists because I can't find a way
  # to create a uniqueness constraint on the join table with 2 foreign keys
  r.stops &lt;&lt; stop unless r.stops.include? stop
end
</code></pre>

1) Create it if it doesn't already exist, 2) Add a relationship to the current stop if it doesn't already exist.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to do this, for example by getting a bunch of the data in memory and doing some of the processing on the app server side, in order to avoid the multitude of database calls I'm currently doing?</p>

<p>And Iâve changed the <code>btnOpenList.OnClientClick=âlinkPostback();â</code></p>

<p>This almost solves the problem.  Iâm still get some animation stutter.  The animation starts to play before the postback and then plays properly after postback.  Using the <code>onclkBehavior.pause()</code> has no effect.  I can get around this by setting the <code>AnimationExtender.Enabled = false</code> and setting it to true in the buttons postback event.  This however works only once as now the AnimationExtender is enabled again.  I have also tried disabling the <code>AnimationExtender</code> via javascript but this has no effect.</p>

<p>Is there a way of playing the animations only via javascript calls?  I need to decouple the automatic link to the 
buttons click event so I can control when the animation is fired.</p>

<p>Hope that makes sense.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> To clarify, I'm specifically interested in the initial selection. I'm dealing with one of those 'Select an item:'-type drop-downs, in which case the first option is really a label, and an action occurs onchange(). This is <em>fairly</em> well 'progressively enhanced', in that a submit button is present, and only removed via javascript.

<p>In each of these situations, I want a way to contain, analyze and filter the path that we get back, or at least some Railsy way to manage routing past the normal 'fallback catchall' url.  Does this exist?</p>

<p>I was thinking about a comment from <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/users/1175/kristopher-johnson"" rel=""nofollow"">Kristopher Johnson</a> about my answer to this <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/50612/software-development-quality"" rel=""nofollow"">question</a> regarding Software Development Quality.</p>

<p>I'd posted a list of software quality metrics that I could think of off the top of my head that included:</p>

<ol>
<li>McCabe Cyclometric Complexity - basically a measure of the number of linear paths through code.</li>
<li>Levels of indentation - a measure of complexity when looking at nested decision statements.</li>
<li>Distance from declaration to first use - how many statements exist between where a variable is declared and where it is first used.</li>
<li>Comment percentage - how many lines of code are comments compared to source code.</li>
<li>Percent test coverage - as a percentage of lines of code, how many are exercised by your suite of tests.</li>
<li>Path test coverage - how many paths of execution are exercised by your tests.</li>
<li>Unit coverage - how many individual units, classes, packages, etc., are exercised by your unit tests.</li>
</ol>

<p>Kris's comment was:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Only the test-coverage metrics listed here could be considered a measure of ""quality."" The others are measurements of complexity and readability, which really has nothing to do with quality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apart from the fact that I don't agree with this statement at all, it got me thinking.</p>

<p>When I have to review code that has hardly any associated tests, whether unit, system or integration, I tend to approach the code much, much more warily than if I see a good suite of tests that have been successfully passed.</p>

<p>Same thing when performing security audits on code. If I see unused variables, huge functions, bizarre mixtures of configs, per server, per dir, etc. being used in Apache modules it also predisposes me to approach the code very warily.</p>

<p>Does anyone else use this initial ""gut feeling"" approach and does it affect the outcome?</p>

<p>BTW I don't agree with Kris's comment because all the other metrics are definitely valid measures that will help highlight badly designed, poorly executed code. As Damian Conway says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.</p>

<p>How do you treat your legacy code?

<p>Saving off all that data into a plist or raw data on disk isn't usually a problem as it's  pretty small, but when an image of any considerable size is placed on the pasteboard, the resulting output can be tens of times larger than the source data (with multiple flavors of TIFF and PICT data being made available via filtering).</p>

<p>And while I accepted your answer as the correct answer, it doesn't exactly answer my original question.  What I was looking for was a way to identify flavors that can become  other flavors simply by placing them on the pasteboard <strong>AND</strong> to know which of these types were originally offered by the provider.  While walking the types list will get me the preferred order for the application that provided them, it won't tell me which ones I can safely ignore as they'll be recreated when I refill the pasteboard later.</p>

<p>I understand prepared statements primarily provide a performance benefit, as well as some auxiliary bonuses such as not having to manually SQL-escape input data.</p>

<p>My question is about the performance part.</p>

<p>I have two implementations of a getPrice function below that takes a product id and returns its price.</p>

<p>getPrice_A reuses the same PDOStatement object across subsequent calls within the same script execution.  Is this necessary or recommended?  If so, is there any way to avoid duplicating this extra code across every single get*() in every single model?</p>

<p>getPrice_B creates a new PDOStatement object on every call.  Will the DBMS recognize this statement has already been prepared and still be able to skip some work?  In other words, does this implementation properly take advantage of the performance benefits of prepared statements?</p>

<p>Having written all this out and read it over, I imagine getPrice_B is fine and getPrice_A is providing a negligible benefit on top of that, which may or may not be worth the extra complication.</p>

<p>I'd still like to hear for sure from someone more knowledgable though.</p>

<p>Assume that <code>$pdo</code> is a valid, connected PDO object in the examples below.</p>

<p>Effectively, I'm taking an originator_id (a number between 0 and 99) and a 'next_element' (it's really just a sequential counter between 1 and 999,999).
We are trying to create a 6-character 'code' from them. </p>

<p>The originator_id is multiplied up by a million, and then the counter added in, giving us a number between 0 and 99,999,999.</p>

<p>Then we convert this into a 'base 32' string - a fake base 32, where we're really just using 0-9 and A-Z but with a few of the more confusing alphanums removed for clarity (I, O, S, Z).</p>

<p>To do this, we just divide the number up by powers of 32, at each stage using the result we get for each power as an index for a character from our array of selected character.</p>

<pre>
Thus, an originator ID of 61 and NextCodeElement of 9 gives a code of '1T5JA9'

(61 * 1,000,000) + 9 = 61,000,009
61,000,009 div (5^32 = 33,554,432) =  1 = '1'
27,445,577 div (4^32 =  1,048,576) = 26 = 'T'
   182,601 div (3^32 =     32,768) =  5 = '5'
    18,761 div (2^32 =      1,024) = 18 = 'J'
       329 div (1^32 =         32) = 10 = 'A'
         9 div (0^32 =          1) =  9 = '9'

so my code is 1T5JA9
</pre>

<p>Previously I've had this algorithm working (in Delphi) but now I really need to be able to recreate it in SQL Server 2005.  Obviously I don't quite have the same functions to hand that I have in Delphi, but this is my take on the routine. It works, and I can generate codes (or reconstruct codes back into their components) just fine.</p>

<p>But it looks a bit long-winded, and I'm not sure that the trick of selecting the result of a division into an int (ie casting it, really) is necessarily 'right' - is there a better SQLS approach to this kind of thing?</p>

<p>I'm not desperately concerned about optimisation unless this method is actually an order of magnitude (or so) worse than any alternative. </p>

<p>The code only ever gets executed in small bursts, maybe generating 20 or 30 codes every 10 minutes or so. Because of the large range of numbers I don't want to pre-calculate the codes into a huge table (only small pockets of the overall code range will be used in any given installation).</p>

<p>This just hangs, no timeout, no nothing.</p>

<p>We've looked at the execution plan, and it consists of many lookups on related tables to ensure no foreign keys would trip up the delete, but we've verified that none of those other tables have any rows referring to that particular row.</p>

<p>There is no other user connected to the database at this time.</p>

<p>We've run DBCC CHECKDB against it, and it reports 0 errors.</p>

<p>Looking at the results of <em><code>sp_who</code></em> and <em><code>sp_lock</code></em> while the query is hanging, I notice that my spid has plenty of PAG and KEY locks, as well as the occasional TAB lock.</p>

<p>The table has 1.777.621 rows, and yes, pk is the primary key, so it's a single row delete based on index. There is no table scan in the execution plan, though I notice that it contains something that says <em>Table Spool (Eager Spool)</em>, but says Estimated number of rows 1. Can this actually be a table-scan in disguise? It only says it looks at the primary key column.</p>

<p>Tried DBCC DBREINDEX and UPDATE STATISTICS on the table. Both completed within reasonable time.</p>

<p>There is unfortunately a high number of indexes on this particular table. It is the core table in our system, with plenty of columns, and references, both outgoing and incoming. The exact number is 48 indexes + the primary key clustered index.</p>

<h2>The Answer</h2>

668,57730,298,2008-09-11T21:40:05Z,,4,Best build process solution to manage build versions,"<p>I run a rather complex project with several independent applications. These use however a couple of shared components. So I have a source tree looking something like the below.</p>

<ul>
<li>My Project 
<ul>
<li>Application A</li>
<li>Shared1</li>
<li>Shared2 </li>
<li>Application B </li>
<li>Application C</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>All applications have their own MSBuild script that builds the project and all the shared resources it needs. I also run these builds on a CruiseControl controlled continuous integration build server. </p>

<p>When the applications are deployed they are deployed on several servers to distribute load. This means that itâs <em>extremely</em> important to keep track of what build/revision is deployed on each of the different servers (we need to have the current version in the DLL version, for example â1.0.0.68â). </p>

<p>Itâs equally important to be able to recreate a revision/build that been built to be able to roll back if something didnât work out as intended (o yes, that happends ...). Today weâre using SourceSafe for source control but that possible to change if we could present good reasons for that (SS itâs actually working ok for us <em>so</em> far). </p>

<p>Another principle that we try to follow is that itâs only code that been build and tested by the integration server that we deploy further. </p>

<h2>""CrusieControl Build Labels"" solution</h2>

<p>We had several ideas on solving the above. The first was to have the continuous integration server build and locally deploy the project and test it (it does that now). As you probably know a successful build in CruiseControl generates a build label and I guess we somehow could use that to set the DLL version of our executables (so build label 35 would create a DLL like â1.0.0.35â )? The idea was also to use this build label to label the <strong>complete</strong> source tree. Then we probably could check out by that label and recreate the build later on. </p>

<p>The reason for labeling the complete tree is to include not only the actual application code (thatâs in one place in the source tree) but also all the shared items (thatâs in different places in the tree). So a successful build of âApplication Aâ would label to whole tree with label âApplicationA35â for example. </p>

<p>There might however be an issue when trying to recreate this build and setting the DLL version before deploying as we then donât have access to the CruiseControl generated build label anymore. If all CrusieControl build labels were unique for all the projects we could use only the number for labeling but thatâs not the case (both application A and B could at the same time be on build 35) so we have to include the application name in the label. Hence SourceSafe label âApplication35â. <strong>How can I then recreate build 34 and set 1.0.0.34 to the DLL version numbers once we built build 35?</strong></p>

<h2>""Revision number"" solution</h2>

<p>Someone told me that Subversion for example creates a revision number for the entire source tree on every check in â <strong>is this the case? Has SourceSafe something similar?</strong> If this is correct the idea is then to grab that revision number when getting latest and build on the CruiseControl server. The revision number could then be used to set the DLL version number (to for example â1.0.0.5678â). I guess we could then get this specific revision for the Subversion if needed and that then would include that application and all the shared items to be able to recreate a specific version from the past. <strong>Would that work and could this also be achived using SourceSafe?</strong></p>

<h2>Summarize</h2>

<p>So the two main requirements are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Be able to <strong>track build/revision number of the build and deployed DLL.</strong></li>
<li>Be able to <strong>rebuild a past revision/build, set the old build/revision number on the executables of that build</strong> (to comply with requirement 1).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>So how would you solve this?</strong> What would be your preferred approach and <strong>how</strong> would you solve it (or do you have a totally different idea?)? **Pleased give detailed answers. **</p>

<p><em>Bonus question</em> What are the difference between a revision number and a build number and when would one really need both?</p>

The problem primarily occurs because the build that the developers do on their local machines is fundamentally different from the build that occurs on the build machine. The devs are building the projects using <code>FlexBuilder/eclipse</code> and the build machine is using the command line compilers. Inevitably, the <code>{projectname}-config.xml</code> and/or the batch file that runs the build get out of sync with the project files used by eclipse, so the the build succeeds on the dev's machine, but fails on the build machine.</p>

<p>We started down the path of writing a utility program to convert FlexBuilder's project files into a <code>{projectname}-config.xml</code> file, but it's a) undocumented and b) a horrible hack.</p>

<p>I've looked into the -dump-config switch to get the config files, but this has a couple of problems: 1) The generated config file has absolute paths which doesn't work in our environment (some developers use macs, some windows machines), and 2) only works right when run from the IDE, so can't be build into the build process.</p>

<p>What I'm after is basically pointing the application at an assembly and choosing a given class from which to select properties that should be included in an exported HTML form as fields. That form will be then used in my ASP.NET MVC app as the beginning of a View.</p>

<p>As I'm using Subsonic objects for the applications where I want to use, this should be reasonable and I figured that, by wanting to include things like differing output HTML depending on data type, Reflection was the way to get this done.</p>

<p>What I'm looking for, however, seems to be elusive. I'm trying to take the DLL/EXE that's chosen through the OpenFileDialog as the starting point and load it:</p>

<pre><code>String FilePath = Path.GetDirectoryName(FileName);
System.Reflection.Assembly o = System.Reflection.Assembly.LoadFile(FileName);
</code></pre>

<p>That works fine, but because Subsonic-generated objects actually are full of object types that are defined in Subsonic.dll, etc., those dependent objects aren't loaded. Enter:</p>

<pre><code>AssemblyName[] ReferencedAssemblies = o.GetReferencedAssemblies();
</code></pre>

<p>That, too, contains exactly what I would expect it to. However, what I'm trying to figure out is how to load those assemblies so that my digging into my objects will work properly. I understand that if those assemblies were in the GAC or in the directory of the running executable, I could just load them by their name, but that isn't likely to be the case for this use case and it's my primary use case.</p>

<p>So, what it boils down to is how do I load a given assembly and all of its arbitrary assemblies starting with a filename and resulting in a completely Reflection-browsable tree of types, properties, methods, etc.</p>

<p>I know that tools like Reflector do this, I just can't find the syntax for getting at it. </p>

<p>If the querysource you do the contains with has more than 10 items in it, it does not pass the items correctly to the SQL query. It is hard to explain what it does, an example will show it best.</p>

<p>If you look at the raw query, the parameters look like this:</p>

<pre><code>@P0 = 'aaa'
@P1 = 'bbb'
@P2 = 'ccc'
... [@P3 through @P9]
@P10 = '111'
@P11 = '222'
... [@p12 through @P19]
@P20 = 'sss'
... [@P21 through @P99]
@P100 = 'qqq'
</code></pre>

<p>when the values are passed into the final query (all parameters resolved) it has resolved the parameters as if these were the values passed:</p>

<pre><code>@P0 = 'aaa'
@P1 = 'bbb'
@P2 = 'ccc'
...
@P10 = 'bbb'0
@P11 = 'bbb'1
...
@P20 = 'ccc'0
...
@P100 = 'bbb'00
</code></pre>

<p>So it looks like the parameter resolving looks at the first digit only after the <code>@P</code> and resolves that, then adds on anything left at the end of the parameter name.</p>

<p>At least that is what the Sql Server Query Visualizer plugin to Visual Studio shows the query doing.</p>

<p>Really strange.</p>

<p>So if any one has advice please share. Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong><br>
I have rewritten the original linq statement to where I now use a join instead of the Contains, but would still like to know if there is a way around this issue.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_pointer"" rel=""nofollow"">PIMPL Idiom</a> (Pointer to IMPLementation) is a technique for implementation hiding in which a public class wraps a structure or class that cannot be seen outside the library the public class is part of.</p>

<p>This hides internal implementation details and data from the user of the library.</p>

<p>When implementing this idiom why would you place the public methods on the pimpl class and not the public class since the public classes method implementations would be compiled into the library and the user only has the header file?</p>

<p>To illustrate, this code puts the <code>Purr()</code> implementation on the impl class and wraps it as well.</p>

<p><strong>Why not implement Purr directly on the public class?</strong></p>

<p>Are there any drawbacks with inline functions?</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</p>

<p>Apparently, There is nothing wrong with using inline functions.</p>

<p>But it is worth noting the following points!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Overuse of inlining can actually make programs slower. Depending on a function's size, inlining it can cause the code size to increase or decrease. Inlining a very small accessor function will usually decrease code size while inlining a very large function can dramatically increase code size. On modern processors smaller code usually runs faster due to better use of the instruction cache. <a href=""http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml#Inline_Functions"">- Google Guidelines</a></p></li>
<li><p>The speed benefits of inline functions tend to diminish as the function grows in size. At some point the overhead of the function call becomes small compared to the execution of the function body, and the benefit is lost <a href=""http://www-rocq.inria.fr/who/Marc.Thiriet/Langages/tic0324.html"">- Source</a></p></li>
<li><p>There are few situations where an inline function may not work:</p>

<ul>
<li>For a function returning values; if a return statement exists.</li>
<li>For a function not returning any values; if a loop, switch or goto statement exists. </li>
<li>If a function is recursive. <a href=""http://www-rocq.inria.fr/who/Marc.Thiriet/Langages/tic0324.html"">-Source</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>The <code>__inline</code> keyword causes a function to be inlined only if you specify the optimize option. If optimize is specified, whether or not <code>__inline</code> is honored depends on the setting of the inline optimizer option. By default, the inline option is in effect whenever the optimizer is run. If you specify optimize , you must also specify the noinline option if you want the <code>__inline</code> keyword to be ignored. <a href=""http://support.sas.com/documentation/onlinedoc/sasc/doc750/html/clug/zcoptinl.htm"">-Source</a></p></li>

The actual feature I would like to implement is to dump the entire output buffer to a text file at the end of program execution.</p>

<p>The workaround I use while I don't find a cleaner approach is to subclass <code>TextWriter</code> overriding the writing methods so they would both write to a file and call the original stdout writer. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public class DirtyWorkaround {
  private class DirtyWriter : TextWriter {
    private TextWriter stdoutWriter;
    private StreamWriter fileWriter;

    public DirtyWriter(string path, TextWriter stdoutWriter) {
      this.stdoutWriter = stdoutWriter;
      this.fileWriter = new StreamWriter(path);
    }

    override public void Write(string s) {
      stdoutWriter.Write(s);

      fileWriter.Write(s);
      fileWriter.Flush();
    }

    // Same as above for WriteLine() and WriteLine(string),
    // plus whatever methods I need to override to inherit
    // from TextWriter (Encoding.Get I guess).
  }

  public static void Main(string[] args) {
    using (DirtyWriter dw = new DirtyWriter(""path"", Console.Out)) {
      Console.SetOut(dw);

      // Teh codez
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>See that it writes to and flushes the file all the time. I'd love to do it only at the end of the execution, but I couldn't find any way to access to the output buffer.</p>

<p>Also, excuse inaccuracies with the above code (had to write it <em>ad hoc</em>, sorry ;).</p>

735,61150,3087,2008-09-14T05:31:57Z,,31,Mocking Static Blocks in Java,"<p>My motto for Java is ""just because Java has static blocks, it doesn't mean that you should be using them."" Jokes aside, there are a lot of tricks in Java that make testing a nightmare. Two of the most I hate are Anonymous Classes and Static Blocks. We have a lot of legacy code that make use of Static Blocks and these are one of the annoying points in our push in writing unit tests. Our goal is to be able to write unit tests for classes that depend on this static initialization with minimal code changes. </p>

<p>So far my suggestion to my colleagues is to move the body of the static block into a private static method and call it <code>staticInit</code>. This method can then be called from within the static block. For unit testing another class that depends on this class could easily mock <code>staticInit</code> with JMockit to not do anything. Let's see this in example.</p>

<pre><code>public class ClassWithStaticInit {
  static {
    System.out.println(""static initializer."");
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Will be changed to</p>

<pre><code>public class ClassWithStaticInit {
  static {
    staticInit();
  }

  private static void staticInit() {
    System.out.println(""static initialized."");
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So that we can do the following in a JUnit.</p>

<pre><code>public class DependentClassTest {
  public static class MockClassWithStaticInit {
    public static void staticInit() {
    }
  }

  @BeforeClass
  public static void setUpBeforeClass() {
    Mockit.redefineMethods(ClassWithStaticInit.class, MockClassWithStaticInit.class);
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>However this solution also comes with its own problems. You can't run <code>DependentClassTest</code> and <code>ClassWithStaticInitTest</code> on the same JVM since you actually want the static block to run for <code>ClassWithStaticInitTest</code>.</p>

<p>What would be your way of accomplishing this task? Or any better, non-JMockit based solutions that you think would work cleaner?</p>

<p>First, what should be the role of testers, designers and non-developers as a whole in the Scrum process?
If they are equal to other team members a couple of issues arise. Designers and testers usually work on a task after development is done, so they cannot adequately plan for a sprint because of this dependency.  </p>

<p>Second, we have deadlines. These are strict and have a lot of impact on prioritization. The end result is backlog changes in the middle of a sprint because of deadline changes, or bad results in the end of the sprint.
We also have a lot of non-technical work like customer support that has to be done in the meantime and cannot be planned as it varies a lot.
So I'm thinking that the team structure, culture and practices are kind of not compatible with Scrum. Scrum for me is a process management tool for teams working on the development of a single software product.  </p>

767,63720,7961,2008-09-15T15:05:05Z,,4,Does Vista do stricter checking of Interface Ids in DCOM calls? (the Stub received bad Data)?,"<p>I hope everyone will pardon the length, and narrative fashion, of this question.  I decided to describe the situation in some detail in my blog.  I later saw Joel's invitation to this site, and I thought I'd paste it here to see if anyone has any insight into the situation.</p>

<p>I wrote, and now support, an application that consists of a Visual Basic thick client speaking DCOM to middle tier COM+ components written in C++ using ATL. It runs in all eight of our offices.  Each office hosts a back-end server that contains the COM+ application (consisting of 18 separate components) and the SQLServer. The SQLServer is typically on the same back-end server, but need not be.</p>

<p>We recently migrated the back-end server in our largest office -- New York -- from a MSC cluster to a new virtual machine hosted on VMWare's ESX technology. Since the location of the COM+ application had moved from the old server to a new one with a different name, I had to redirect all the clients so that they activated the COM+ application on the new server. The procedure was old hat as I had done essentially the same thing for several of my smaller offices that had gone through similar infrastructure upgrades.</p>

<p>All seemed routine and on Monday morning the entire office -- about 1,000 Windows XP workstations -- were running without incident on the new server. But then the call came from my mobile group -- there was an attorney working from home with a VPN connection that was getting a strange error after being redirected to the new server:</p>

<pre>
Error on FillTreeView2 - The stub received bad data.
</pre>

<p>Huh? I had never seen this error message before. Was it the new server? But all the workstations in the office were working fine. I told the mobile group to switch the attorney back to the old sever (which was still up), and the error disappeared. So what was the difference? Turns out this attorney was running Vista at home.</p>

<p>We don't run Vista in any of our offices, but we do have some attorneys that run Vista at home (certainly some in my New York office). I do as well and I've never seen this problem. To confirm that there was an issue, I fired up my Vista laptop, pointed it to the new server, and got the same error. I pointed it back to the old server, and it worked fine. Clearly there was some problem with Vista and the components on the new server -- a problem that did not seem to affect XP clients. What could it be?</p>

<p>Next stop -- the application error log on my laptop. This yielded more information on the error:</p>

Description:   Application has failed to complete a COM call because an incorrect
interface ID was passed as a parameter.

The expected Interface ID was 00000555-0000-0010-8000-00aa006d2ea4, 
The Interface ID returned was 00000556-0000-0010-8000-00aa006d2ea4.

User Action - Contact the application vendor for updated version of the application.
</pre>

<p>The interface ids provided the clue I needed to unravel the mystery. The ""expected"" interface id identifies MDAC's Recordset interface -- specifically version 2.1 of that interface. The ""returned"" interface corresponds to a later version of Recordset (version 2.5 which differs from version 2.1 by the inclusion of one additional entry at the end of the vtable -- method Save).</p>

<p>Indeed my component's interfaces expose many methods that pass Recordset as an output parameter. So were they suddenly returning a later version of Recordset -- with a different interface id? It certainly appeared to be the case. And then I thought, why should it matter. The vtable looks the same to clients of the older interface. Indeed, I suspect that if we were talking about in-process COM, and not DCOM, this apparently innocuous impedance mismatch would have been silently ignored and would have caused no issues.</p>

<p>Of course, when process and machine boundaries come into play, there is a proxy and a stub between the client and the server. In this case, I was using type library marshaling with the free threaded marshaller. So there were two mysteries to solve:</p>

<p>Why was I returning a different interface in the output parameters from methods on my new server?</p>

<p>Why did this affect only Vista clients?</p>

<p>As my server software was hosted on servers at each of my eight offices, I decided to try pointing my Vista client at all of them in sequence to see which had problems with Vista and which didn't. Illuminating test. Some of the older servers still worked with Vista but the newer ones did not. Although some of the older servers were still running Windows 2000 while the newer ones were at 2003, that did not seem to be the issue.</p>

<p>After comparing the dates of the component DLLs it appeared that whenever the client pointed to servers with component DLLs dated before 2003 Vista was fine. But those that had DLLs with dates after 2003 were problematic. Believe it or nor, there were no (or at least no significant) changes to the code on the server components in many years. Apparently the differing dates were simply due to recompiles of my components on my development machine(s). And it appeared that one of those recompiles happened in 2003.</p>

<p>The light bulb went on. When passing Recordsets back from server to client, my ATL C++ components refer to the interface as _Recordset. This symbol comes from the type library embedded within msado15.dll. This is the line I had in the C++ code:</p>

<pre>
#import ""c:\Program Files\Common Files\System\ADO\msado15.dll"" no_namespace rename ( ""EOF"", ""adoEOF"" )
</pre>

<p>Don't be deceived by the 15 in msdad15.dll. Apparently this DLL has not changed name in the long series of MDAC versions.</p>

<p>When I compiled the application back in the day, the version of MDAC was 2.1. So _Recordset compiled with the 2.1 interface id and that is the interface returned by the servers running those components.</p>

<p>All the client's use the COM+ application proxy that was generated (I believe) back in 1999. The type library that defines my interfaces includes the line:</p>

<pre>
importlib(""msado21.tlb"");
</pre>

<p>which explains why they expect version 2.1 of Recordset in my method's output parameters. Clearly the problem was with my 2003 recompile and the fact that at that time the _Recordset symbol no longer corresponded to version 2.1. Indeed _Recordset corresponded to the 2.5 version with its distinct interface id. The solution for me was to change all references from _Recordset to Recordset21 in my C++ code. I rebuilt the components and deployed them to the new server. Voila -- the clients seemed happy again.</p>

<p>In conclusion, there are two nagging questions that remain for me.</p>

<p>Why does the proxy/stub infrastructure seem to behave differently with Vista clients? It appears that Vista is making stricter checks of the interface ids coming back from method parameters than is XP.</p>

<p>How should I have coded this differently back in 1999 so that this would not have happened? Interfaces are supposed to be immutable and when I recompiled under a newer version of MDAC, I inadvertently changed my interface because the methods now returned a different Recordset interface as an output parameter. As far as I know, the type library back then did not have a version-specific symbol -- that is, later versions of the MDAC type libraries define Recordset21, but that symbol was not available back in the 2.1 type library.</p>

<p>In my game engine, I have designed a ""chase cam"" of sorts, that can be attached to an object and then recalculates its position relative to the object. When the object moves, there are two ways to update the chase cam.</p>

<ul>
<li>Have an ""UpdateCameras()"" method in the main game loop.</li>
<li>Use an event handler, and have the chase cam subscribe to object.OnMoved.</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm using the latter, because it allows me to chain events together and nicely automate large parts of the engine. Suddenly, what would be huge and complex get dropped down to a handful of 3-5 line event handlers...Its a beauty.</p>

<p>However, if event handlers firing every nanosecond turn out to be a major slowdown, I'll remove it and go with the loop approach.</p>

<p>Ideas?</p>

I know Javascript alone can not do this, but I'm interested in the least proprietary method to augment my Javascript with. My targeted browsers are Firefox for PC and Mac (so no ActiveX). Please share your experiences with this. I gather it can be done with Flash (but not as a WAV formated file). I gather it can be done with Java (but not without code-signing). Are these the only options?</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/64010/how-does-one-record-audio-from-a-javascript-based-webapp#64159"">@dominic-mazzoni</a> I'd like to record the file as a WAV because because the purpose of the webapp will be to assemble a library of <em>good</em> quality short soundbites. I estimate upload will be 50 MB, which is well worth it for the quality. The app will only be used on our intranet.</p>

<p>UPDATE: There's now an alternate solution thanks to JetPack's upcoming Audio API: See <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Jetpack/JEP/18"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Jetpack/JEP/18</a></p>

<p>Most of them crash when opening a file or simply corrupt the data. Many don't run at all. It seems to me that most were written 3-4 years ago for AS2 .sols and no longer work with FP9/AS3 sols. I'd attempt to write my own using AIR but I can't find a new spec of the byte format.</p>

<p>There's an explanation of the file format here:
<a href=""http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=27026&amp;group_id=131628"">http://sourceforge.net/docman/display_doc.php?docid=27026&amp;group_id=131628</a></p>

<p>but it looks as though both of these docs are a good 4 years old (pre-FP9) and as I'm not skilled or experienced in file formats,  writing a new one, especially without an updated spec, is seeming like less and less of a viable option. </p>

<p>Ideally I'd like one that can not only read the .sol, but edit and save new values also.</p>

<p>My boss is convinced that compiling our (<strong><em>my</em></strong>) webapp into a binary executable is a brilliant idea.  (Then again, he likes nice, small simple things with blinky lights that he can understand.)  He instinctively sees no issues with this, while I only see an endless series of problems and degradations.  Once I start talking to him about the complexity of our platform, and more in depth specifics of byte code, JVMs, libraries, differences between operating systems, processor architectures, etc...well...his eyes glaze over, he smiles and he has made it clear he thinks I'm being childishly resistive.</p>

<p>Why does he want a single magic executable?  He sees a couple of ""benefits"":</p>

<ul>
<li>If it is a binary executable, then it is hard to reverse engineer and circumvent any licensing.  Management lives in constant fear that this is happening, even though we sell into larger corporates who generally do not do cheat with server software.  </li>
<li>There is that vision of downloading this magic executable, running it, and everything works. (No more sending me out to do customer installations, which is not that frequent.)</li>
</ul>

<p>So, I've done my obligatory 20 minutes of googling, and now I am here.  </p>

<p>A bit of background on my application: </p>

<p><strong>What it is made from:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Java 6 (Sun's JVM)</li>
<li>AspectJ 1.6</li>
<li>Tomcat 6</li>
<li>Hibernate 3</li>
<li>Spring 2</li>
<li>another two dozen supporting jar files</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What it does</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>A streaming media CMS</li>
<li>Performance sensitive</li>
<li>Deployed on Linux, Solaris, Windows (and developed on a Mac)</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can probably gather, I'm highly skeptical of this <em>""compiling Java to native code""</em> thing.  It sound like where Mono (VB on Linux) was back in 2000.  But am I being overly pessimistic?  Is it viable?  Should I actually spend the time (days if not weeks) to try this out?</p>

Custom configuration management software is used to write out the server.xml, and various resources (connection pools, beans, server variables, etc) written into server.xml configure the servlet. This is all well and good.</p>

<p>However, the names of some of the resources aren't known in advance. For example, the Servlet may need access to any number of ""Anonymizers"" as configured by the operator. Each anonymizer has a unique name associated with it. We create and configure each anonymizer using java beans similar to the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Resource
  name=""bean/Anonymizer_toon""
  type=""com.company.tomcatutil.AnonymizerBean""
  factory=""org.apache.naming.factory.BeanFactory""
  className=""teAnonymizer""
  databaseId=""50""

  name=""bean/Anonymizer_default""
  type=""com.company.tomcatutil.AnonymizerBean""
  factory=""org.apache.naming.factory.BeanFactory""
  className=""teAnonymizer""
  databaseId=""54""
/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>However, this appears to require us to have explicit entries in the Servlet's context.xml file for each an every possible resource name in advance. I'd like to replace the explicit context.xml entries with wildcards, or know if there is a better solution to this type of problem.</p>

<p>Currently:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;ResourceLink name=""bean/Anonymizer_default""
                global=""bean/Anonymizer_default""
                type=""com.company.tomcatutil.AnonymizerBean""/&gt;

  &lt;ResourceLink name=""bean/Anonymizer_toon""

                type=""com.company.tomcatutil.AnonymizerBean""/&gt;

<p>Here is the script as it stands now:</p>

<pre><code>tell application ""System Events""
    tell (first process whose frontmost is true)
    	set helpMenuItem to menu bar item ""Help"" of menu bar 1

<pre><code>tell application ""System Events""
    tell (first process whose frontmost is true)
    	set helpMenuItem to menu bar item ""Help"" of menu bar 1
    	set searchBox to menu item 1 of menu of helpMenuItem
    	if (searchBox's focused) = true then
    		key code 53 -- type esc

I have understood that because of Ruby's metaprogramming facilities my unit-tests become much cleaner and I don't need nasty mocking frameworks. I have a class which needs the <code>File</code> class's services and in my test I don't want to touch my real filesystem. In Java I would use some virtual file system for easier ""seams"" to pass fake-objects in but in Ruby that's obviously overkill. What I come up seems already really nice compared to the Java-world. In my class under test I have an optional constructor parameter: </p>

<pre><code>def initialize(file_class=File)
</code></pre>

<p>When I need to open files within my class, I can then do this:</p>

<pre><code>@file_class.open(filename)
</code></pre>

<p>And the call goes to either the real File-class, or in case of my unit-test, it goes to a fake-class which doesn't touch the filesystem. I know there must be a better way to do this with metaprogramming?</p>

The problem is that dialog is set to be always on top but when user clicks on IE window dialog gets hidden behind IE window nevertheless. And since dialog is modal and holds <strong>all</strong> IE threads IE pane does not refresh and dialog window is still painted on top of IE (but not refreshed). This behaviour confuses users (they <em>see</em> dialog on top of IE but it looks like it has hanged since it is not refreshe). </p>

<p>So I need a way to keep that dialog on top of everything. But any other solution to this problem would be nice. </p>

<p>Here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>        PassDialog dialog = new PassDialog(parent);

	pDC-&gt;FillSolidRect(0, 0, m_SizeX, kGroupHeaderHeight, kBackgroundColour);

I'm developing in C++, but this is probably more of a general Windows API question.</p>

<p>For reference, here is code to get the Application Data folder under both systems:</p>

<pre><code>	HRESULT hres; 
	CString basePath;
	hres = SHGetSpecialFolderPath(this-&gt;GetSafeHwnd(), basePath.GetBuffer(MAX_PATH), CSIDL_APPDATA, FALSE);
	basePath.ReleaseBuffer();
</code></pre>

<p>I suspect this is just a matter of knowing which sub-folder Microsoft uses.</p>

<p>Under Windows XP, the app data subfolder is:</p>

<p>Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch</p>

<p>Under Vista, it appears that the sub-folder has been changed to:</p>

<p>Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch</p>

<p>but I'd like to make sure that this is the correct way to determine the correct location.</p>

<p>Finding the <em>correct</em> way to determine this location is quite important, as relying on hard coded folder names almost always breaks as you move into international installs, etc...  The fact that the folder is named 'Roaming' in Vista makes me wonder if there is some special handling related to that folder (akin to the Local Settings folder under XP).</p>

<p>EDIT:
The following msdn article:  <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb762494.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb762494.aspx</a> indicates that CSIDL_APPDATA has an equivalent ID of FOLDERID_RoamingAppData, which does seem to support StocksR's assertion that CSIDL_APPDATA does return C:\Users\xxxx\AppData\Roaming, so it should be possible to use the same relative path for CSIDL_APPDATA to get to quick launch (\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch).</p>

<p>So the following algorithm is correct per MS:</p>

<pre><code>HRESULT hres; 
CString basePath;
hres = SHGetSpecialFolderPath(this-&gt;GetSafeHwnd(), basePath.GetBuffer(MAX_PATH), CSIDL_APPDATA, FALSE);
basePath.ReleaseBuffer();
CString qlPath = basePath + ""\\Microsoft\\Internet Explorer\\Quick Launch"";
</code></pre>

<p>it would also be a good idea to check hres to ensure that the call to SHGetSpecialFolderPath was successful.</p>

<p>My app requires read/modify/write access to a SQLCE database file (.sdf) and some other database-type files related to a third-party control I'm using. These files should be shared among all users/log-ins on the PC, none of which can be required to be an Administrator. This means, of course, that the files can't go in the program's own installation directory (as such things often did before the arrival of Vista, yes, yes!).</p>

<p>I had expected the solution to be simple. <strong>Vista and XP both have shared-application-data folders intended for this purpose.</strong> (""\ProgramData"" in Vista, ""\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data"" in XP.) The .NET Environment.GetFolderPath(SpecialFolder.CommonApplicationData) call exists to find the paths to these folders on a given PC, yes, yes!</p>

<p><strong>But I can't figure out how to specify the shared-application-data folder as a target in the Setup project.</strong></p>

- Just setting the ReadOnly property to true is not a viable solution, as it looks dumb having things greyed out like that.
- Avoiding manually creating a secondary view is the entire point of this, so using an ingenious way to display a read only version of the user interface that was built by hand using labels is wat I am trying to avoid.</p>

I'm assuming this is because the DB connection is not being closed properly when IIS kills the session.</p>

The user selects which plan they want to edit on the main screen, so the plan id goes into the session variable. Is it better to try and reduce the load on the DB by storing all the details about the user (and their manager etc.) and the plan they are editing in the session variable or should I try to minimise the stuff in the session variable and query the DB for everything I need in the Page_Load event?</p>

According to the <a href=""http://www.reportlab.com/docs/userguide.pdf"">user guide</a>,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Special TableStyle Indeces [sic]</p>
  
  <p>In any style command the first row index may be set to one of the special strings 'splitlast' or 'splitfirst' to indicate that the style should be used only for the last row of a split table, or the first row of a continuation. This allows splitting tables with nicer effects around the split.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I've tried using several style elements, including:</p>

<pre><code>('TEXTCOLOR', (0, 'splitfirst'), (1, 'splitfirst'), colors.black) 
('TEXTCOLOR', (0, 'splitfirst'), (1, 0), colors.black) 
('TEXTCOLOR', (0, 'splitfirst'), (1, -1), colors.black)

942,78560,10135,2008-09-17T00:10:52Z,,3,Locked SQL Server Data Files,"<p>I have an SQL Server database where I have the data and log files stored on an external USB drive.  I switch the external drive between my main development machine in my office and my laptop when not in my office.  I am trying to use sp_detach_db and sp_attach_db when moving between desktop and laptop machines.  I find that this works OK on the desktop - I can detach and reattach the database there no problems.  But on the laptop I cannot reattach the database (the database was actually originally created on the laptop and the first detach happened there).  When I try to reattach on the laptop I get the following error:</p>

<p>Unable to open the physical file ""p:\SQLData\AppManager.mdf"". Operating system error 5: ""5(error not found)""</p>

<p>I find a lot of references to this error all stating that it is a permissions issue.  So I went down this path and made sure that the SQL Server service account has appropriate permissions.  I have also created a new database on this same path and been able to succesfully detach and reattach it.  So I am confident permissions is not the issue.</p>

<p>Further investigation reveals that I cannot rename, copy or move the data files as Windows thinks they are locked - even when the SQL Server service is stopped.  Process Explorer does not show up any process locking the files.  </p>

<p>How can I find out what is locking the files and unlock them.</p>

<p>I have verified that the databases do not show up in SSMS - so SQL Server does not still think they exist.</p>

<p><strong>Update 18/09/2008</strong></p>

<p>I have tried all of the suggested answers to date with no success.  However trying these suggestions has helped to clarify the situation.  I can verify the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>I can successfully detach and reattach the database only when the external drive is attached to the server that a copy of the database is restored to - effectively the server where the database is ""created"" - lets call this the ""Source Server"".  </li>
<li>I can move, copy or rename the data and log files, after detaching the database, while the external drive is still attached to the Source Server.  </li>
<li>As soon as I move the external drive to another machine the data and log files are ""locked"", although the 2 tools that I have tried - Process Explorer and Unlocker, both find no locking handles attached to the files. </li>
</ol>

<p>NB.  After detaching the database I tried both stopping the SQL Server service and shutting down the Source Server prior to moving the external drive - still with no success.</p>

<p>So at this stage all that I can do to move data between desktop and laptop is to make a backup of the data onto the external drive, move the external drive, restore the data from the backup.  Works OK but takes a bit more time as the database is a reasonable size (1gb).  Anyway this is the only choice I have at this stage even though I was trying to avoid having to go down this path.</p>

attributes that do not have errors attached to them. 
So a model can be updated without being valid overall, and this will 
still prevent saving invalid data to the database.</p>

<p>By ""valid attributes"", I mean those attributes that give nil when calling @model_instance.errors.on(:attribute)</p>

<p>Anyone have an idea of how to accomplish this?</p>

<p>So far, I have the following:</p>

<pre><code>def save_valid_attributes 
 valid? 
 update_atrtibutes attributes.inject({}){|k, v, m| m[k] = v unless errors_on(k.to_sym); m} 
end
</code></pre>

<p>This works if there's no processing done on assignment, which in my case there is.
For example, I have a database column ""start_date"", and two methods defined:</p>

<pre><code>def nice_start_date=(startdate)
 self.start_date = Chronic.parse(startdate) || startdate
end

def nice_start_date
 self.start_date.to_s
end
</code></pre>

<p>These two methods allow me to properly parse the user inputted dates using Chronic before saving. So, second way of doing this, one attribute at a time:</p>

<pre><code>def save_valid_attributes(attrib) 
  valid?
  attrib.each{|(k,v)| send(""${k}="", v); save; reload)
end
</code></pre>

<p>The model needs to be reloaded each time since, if one of the dates is invalid and doesn't save, it will prevent all further attributes from saving.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to do this? I'm sure this isn't an uncommon problem in the Rails world, I just can't seem to find anything in the Google universe of knowledge.</p>

<p>Say I have a table <em>users(userId, name)</em> and a table <em>preferences(id, userId, language)</em>. The example is trivial, but could be extended to a situation with multi-level relations and way more tables..
When my UI requests to delete a user I first want to show a warning stating that also its preferences will be deleted. If at some point the database gets extended with more tables and relationships, but the software isn't adapted accordingly (client didn't update) a generic message should be shown.</p>

<p>How can I implement this? The UI cannot know about the whole data structure and should not be bothered to walk down all the relations to manually delete all the depending records.<br />
I would think this would be with constraints.
The constraint would be <em>no action</em> at first so the constraint will throw an error that can be caught by the UI. After the UI receives a confirmation, the constraint should become a <em>cascade</em>.</p>

1014,85010,,2008-09-17T16:26:08Z,,0,Object Oriented Update Approach,"<p>I've been tasked with maintaining an application originally written in VB6. It has since been imported into VB .Net and to say the least the code is anything but Object Oriented. The code is riddled with classes which contain nothing more than Public Shared attributes(variables) and methods(functions), the result of which restricts the application from opening more than one project at a time.</p>

<p>A project consists of a XML file which contains general project settings, as well as the location to an Access database which contains other project related data. Over the years the format of the XML file has been modified, and an update and versioning strategy has been adopted. The chosen strategy performs an update upon open whenever an old version is encountered. Thus far, updates have only consisted of rearranging data within the XML file or making database schema changes and moving data from the XML file to the database.</p>

<p>Having quite a bit of background in OOP it's easy for me to see that a project should be a self contained object which other objects interact with. However, I fail to see how to apply the chosen update strategy in OOP.</p>

The code was ugly, but it was ugly before it was even compiled, and I'm quite impressed that everything still seems to work fine.</p>

<li>Multiple Grid elements to represent the maps at different zoom levels.  Using a grid to make tiling easier.</li>

One of my first points of business with this application was to at least move the session data away from InProc, and off load it to either a stateserver or SQL Server.</p>

<p>After I made all of the appropriate data objects serializable, and changed the web.config to use a state service, everything appeared to work fine. </p>

<p>However, I found that this application does a lot of object comparisons using GetHashCode(). Methods that worked fine when the session was InProc no longer work because the HashCodes no longer match when they are supposed to. This appears to be the case when trying to find a specific child object from a parent when you know the child object's original hash code</p>

<p>If I simply change the web.config back to using inproc, it works again.</p>

<p>Anyone have any thoughts on where to begin with this?</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<p>qbeuek: thanks for the quick reply. In regards to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The default implementation of GetHashCode in Object class return a hash value based on objects address in memory or something similar. If some other identity comparison is required, you have to override both Equals and GetHashCode.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I should have given more information on how they are using this. Basically, they have one parent data object, and there are several arrays of child objects. They happen to know the hash code for a particular object they need, so they are looping through a specific array of child objects looking for a hash code that matches. Once a match is found, they then use that object for other work.</p>

<p>Basically, I need to get a series of web responses so I can test I am parsing the varying responses correctly, rather than hit their servers every time, I thought I could do this once, save the XML and then work locally.</p>

<p>However, I don't see how I can ""mock"" a WebResponse, since (AFAIK) they can only be instantiated by <strong>WebRequest.GetResponse</strong></p>

<p>How do you guys go about mocking this sort of thing? Do you? I just really don't like the fact I am hammering their servers :S I dont want to change the code <em>too</em> much, but I expect there is a elegant way of doing this..</p>

<h2>Update Following Accept</h2>

<p>Will's answer was the slap in the face I needed, I knew I was missing a fundamental point!</p>

<ul>
<li>Create an Interface that will return a proxy object which represents the XML.</li>
<li>Implement the interface twice, one that uses WebRequest, the other that returns static ""responses"".</li>
<li>The interface implmentation then either instantiates the return type based on the response, or the static XML.</li>
<li>You can then pass the required class when testing or at production to the service layer.</li>
</ul>

<p>Related, is it possible to add new User scoped application settings AT RUNTIME? I totally see how to add settings at design time, that's not a problem. But what if I want to create one at runtime?</p>

<p>More details:</p>

<p>My application is a conversion of an existing Visual FoxPro application. I've been trying to read as much as I can about application settings, user settings, etc. and get myself clear on the .Net way of doing things, but there are still several things I am confused on.</p>

<p>In the Fox app, saved settings are stored in the registry. My forms are subclassed, and I have base class code that automatically saves the form position and size in the registry keyed on the form name. Whenever I create a new form, I don't have to do anything special to get this behavior; it's built in to the base class. My .Net forms are also subclassed, that part is working well.</p>

<p>In .Net, I get the impression I'm supposed to use User scoped settings for things like user preferences. Size and location of a form definitely seem like a user preference. But, I can't see any way to automatically add these settings to the project. In other words, every time I add a new form to my project (and their are 100's of forms), I have to remember to ADD a User scoped application setting and be sure to give it the same name as the form, i.e.,  ""FormMySpecialSizePosition"" to hold the size and position. I'd rather not have to remember to do that. Is this just tough luck? Or am I totally barking up the wrong tree by trying to use User scoped settings? Do I need to create my own XML file to hold settings, so that I can do whatever I want (i.e, add a new setting at runtime)? Or something else?</p>

<p>Surely this is a very common and somebody can tell the ""right"" way to do it. Thanks in advance!</p>

This is causing later joins on the dataset to have an estimated result of one row, when some of them go as high as 30,000.</p>

<p>With a count of 1, the QO is choosing a loop join/index seek strategy for many of the joins which is much too slow. I worked around the issue by constraining the possible join strategies with a <code>WITH OPTION (HASH JOIN, MERGE JOIN)</code>, which improved overall execution time from 60+ minutes to 12 seconds. However, I think the QO is still generating a less than optimal plan because of the bad rowcounts. I don't want to specify the join order and details manually-- there are too many queries affected by this for it to be worthwhile.</p>

<p>This is in Microsoft SQL Server 2000, a medium query with several table selects joined to the main select.</p>

<p>I think the QO may be overestimating the cardinality of the many side on the join, expecting the joining columns between the tables to have less rows in common.</p>

<p>The estimated row counts from scanning the indexes before the join are accurate, it's only the estimated row count after certain joins that's much too low.</p>

<p>The statistics for all the tables in the DB are up to date and refreshed automatically.</p>

<p>One of the early bad joins is between a generic 'Person' table for information common to all people and a specialized person table that about 5% of all those people belong to. The clustered PK in both tables (and the join column) is an INT. The database is highly normalized.</p>

<p>I believe that the root problem is the bad row count estimate after certain joins, so my main questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>How can I fix the QO's post join rowcount estimate?</li>
<li>Is there a way that I can hint that a join will have a lot of rows without specifying the entire join order manually?</li>

<p>My question is, is there a java obfuscation application that gets better size reduction results than the other java obfuscation apps that are out there? </p>

<p>I use Proguard because it is the default Netbeans obfuscator and you can get fairly good size reduction results out of it (by the way, the version of Proguard that comes with Netbeans 6.1 is 3.7. There are newer versions that get even better results, I recommend getting the latest). But, I'm interested in what else is out there and whether they do a better job than Proguard.</p>

<p><strong>My Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>I appreciate the responses. Carlos, your response was enough to convince me that Proguard is the current way to go. I could still be convinced otherwise, but don't feel bad with my current setup.</p>

<p>I have also had some issues with proguard obfuscating and running on some phones, but not too many. I was always able to fix the problem by not using the Proguard argument ""-overloadaggressively"". Just something to keep in mind if you are experiencing odd behavior related to obfuscating.</p>

<p>It seems date controls within Infopath 2007 screw with rendering somehow.  To test, I made  2 variations of a VERY simple form - one with a date control, one with a text control - and placed them inside a table.</p>

<p>When emailed, the one with the date control rendered incorrectly.</p>

<p>My question is - has anyone experienced this before?  If you have time, test it out.  I think it is a bug or something, but not exactly sure.</p>

As such, it uses asynchronous callbacks for all the calls to the methods of the service.  If the service is not running, or it crashes, or the network goes down, etc before or during one of these calls, an exception is generated as you would expect.  The problem is, I don't know how to catch this exception.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Because it is an asynchronous call, I can't wrap my begin call with a try/catch block and have it pick up an exception that happens after the program has moved on from that point.</p></li>
<li><p>Because the service proxy is automatically generated, I can't put a try/catch block on each and every generated function that calls EndInvoke (where the exception actually shows up).  These generated functions are also surrounded by External Code in the call stack, so there's nowhere else in the stack to put a try/catch either.</p></li>
<li><p>I can't put the try/catch in my callback functions, because the exception occurs before they would get called.</p></li>
<li><p>There is an Application_UnhandledException function in my App.xaml.cs, which captures all unhandled exceptions.  I could use this, but it seems like a messy way to do it.  I'd rather reserve this function for the truly unexpected errors (aka bugs) and not end up with code in this function for every circumstance I'd like to deal with in a specific way.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Am I missing an obvious solution?  Or am I stuck using Application_UnhandledException?</p>

<p>[Edit]<br />
As mentioned below, the Error property is exactly what I was looking for.  What is throwing me for a loop is that the fact that the exception is thrown and appears to be uncaught, yet execution is able to continue.  It triggers the Application_UnhandledException event and causes VS2008 to break execution, but continuing in the debugger allows execution to continue.  It's not really a problem, it just seems odd.</p>

If you are serving pages or services out of a prefork Apache the child processes will be tied up for seconds serving a single mobile client, even if your app server logic is done in 5ms. I am looking for a HTTP server, balancer or proxy server that supports the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>A request arrives to the proxy. The proxy starts buffering in RAM or in disk the request, including headers and POST/PUT bodies. The proxy DOES NOT open a connection to the backend server. This is probably the most important part.</p></li>
<li><p>The proxy server stops buffering the request when:</p>

<ul>
<li>A size limit has been reached (say, 4KB), or</li>
<li>The request has been received completely, headers and body</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Only now, with (part of) the request in memory, a connection is opened to the backend and the request is relayed.</p></li>
<li><p>The backend sends back the response. Again the proxy server starts buffering it immediately (up to a more generous size, say 64KB.) </p></li>
<li><p>Since the proxy has a big enough buffer the backend response is stored completely in the proxy server in a matter of miliseconds, and the backend process/thread is free to process more requests. The backend connection is immediately closed.</p></li>
<li><p>The proxy sends back the response to the mobile client, as fast or as slow as it is capable of, without having a connection to the backend tying up resources.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I am fairly sure you can do 4-6 with Squid, and nginx appears to support 1-3 (and looks like fairly unique in this respect). My question is: is there any proxy server that empathizes these buffering and not-opening-connections-until-ready capabilities? Maybe there is just a bit of Apache config-fu that makes this buffering behaviour trivial? Any of them that it is not a dinosaur like Squid and that supports a lean single-process, asynchronous, event-based execution model?</p>

<p>(Siderant: I would be using nginx but it doesn't support chunked POST bodies, making it useless for serving stuff to mobile clients. Yes cheap 50$ handsets love chunked POSTs... sigh)</p>

<p>Thank you all for your help.  I'm embarrassed to admit that this was all my mistake.

<p>As for spoofing the loopback address, you guys are right.  I shouldn't have made it sound like the primary concern.

<p>The basic problem here as I see it is that an interop assembly doesn't actually contain any IL that can be instrumented (except for maybe a few delegates). So, although I can put together a test project that exercises the interop layer, I can't get a sense for <em>how many</em> of those methods and properties I'm actually calling.</p>

<p>Plan B is to go and write a code generator that creates a library of RCWWs (Runtime Callable Wrapper Wrappers), and instrument that for the purposes of code coverage.</p>

<p>Edit: @<a href=""#148618"" rel=""nofollow"">Franci Penov</a>,</p>

<p>Yes that's exactly what I want to do. The COM components delivered to us constitute a library of some dozen DLLs containing approx. 3000 types. We consume that library in our application and are charged with testing that Interop layer, since the group delivering the libraries to us does minimal testing. Code coverage would allow us to ensure that all interfaces and coclasses are exercised. That's all I'm attempting to do. We have separate test projects that exercise our own managed code.</p>

<p>Yes, ideally the COM server team should be testing and analyzing their own code, but we don't live in an ideal world and I have to deliver a quality product based on their work. If can produce a test report indicating that I've tested 80% of their code interfaces and 50% of those don't work as advertised, I can get fixes done where fixes need to be done, and not workaround problems.</p>

<p>The mock layer you mentioned would be useful, but wouldn't ultimately be achieving the goal of testing the Interop layer itself, and I certainly would not want to be maintaining it by hand -- we are at the mercy of the COM guys in terms of changes to the interfaces.</p>

<ol>
<li>OnStuff += this.Handle; </li>
<li>OnStuff += new StuffEventHandler(this.Handle);</li>
</ol>

<p>The first one is clean, and it makes sense doing ""OnStuff -= this.Handle;"" to unregister from the event... But with the latter case, should I do ""OnStuff -= new StuffEventHandler(this.Handle);""? It feels like I am not removing anything at all, since I'm throwing in another StuffEventHandler reference. Does the event compare the delegate by reference? I am concerned I could start a nasty memory pool here. Get me? I don't have the reference to the ""new StuffEventHandler"" I previously registered.</p>

<p>When I compare two files it always seems to put the first file (alphabetically) on the left, and the latter one on the right, but I want to be able to change this on a comparison by comparison basis.<br />
IE comparing 'file-a' and 'file-b' will always have 'file-a' on the left, but that isn't always what I want. I seem to recall in earlier versions of Eclipse that changing the file that was right-clicked when choosing Compare With -> Each Other changed the order, but that isn't working for me in 3.4.</p>

<p>An example of why I care:<br />
I've just performed a subversion merge and had a conflict, so I now have the following files:<br />
<em>file<br />
file.merge-left<br />
file.merge-right<br />
file.working</em>  </p>

<p>I've made changes to <em>file</em> and now want to compare <em>file</em> to <em>file.merge-right</em> and <em>file.working</em> to <em>file.merge-left</em> and split the editors so I can have the working/left changes sitting above the file/right changes, and then just page through the compare editors and make sure the differences between this file and the file that the merge comes from have been preserved, but <em>file</em> is on the left while <em>file.working</em> is on the right, and hence the differences need to be compared diagonally rather than just comparing top and bottom.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>It looks like the tricky part here may lie in the fact that the path is relative to the .csproj file, not the .sln file which is the current directory in Vim and lies one directory above the .csproj file.</p>

<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>
I figured it out...</p>

<pre><code>set errorformat=\ %#%f(%l\\\,%c):\ %m
</code></pre>

<p>This will capture the output for both devenv /Build and msbuild.
However, msbuild has one catch.  By default, it's output doesn't include full paths.  To fix this you have to add the following line to your csproj file's main PropertyGroup:</p>

<p>I started thinking about the hash code that a tuple should have. 
What if we will accept KeyValuePair class as a tuple? It doesn't override the GetHashCode() method, so probably it won't be aware of the hash codes of it's ""children""... So, run-time will call Object.GetHashCode(), which is not aware of the real object structure.</p>

<p>Then we can make two instances of some reference type, which are actually Equal, because of the overloaded GetHashCode() and Equals(). And use them as ""children"" in tuples to ""cheat"" the dictionary.</p>

<p>But it doesn't work! Run-time somehow figures out the structure of our tuple and calls the overloaded GetHashCode of our class!</p>

<p>How does it work? What's the analysis made by Object.GetHashCode()? </p>

<p>Can it affect the performance in some bad scenario, when we use some complicated keys? (probably, impossible scenario... but still)</p>

<p>Consider this code as an example:</p>

<pre><code>namespace csharp_tricks
{
    class Program
    {
        class MyClass
        {
            int keyValue;
            int someInfo;

            public MyClass(int key, int info)
            {
                keyValue = key;
                someInfo = info;
            }

            public override bool Equals(object obj)
            {
                MyClass other = obj as MyClass;
                if (other == null) return false;

                return keyValue.Equals(other.keyValue);
            }

            public override int GetHashCode()
            {
                return keyValue.GetHashCode();
            }
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Dictionary&lt;object, object&gt; dict = new Dictionary&lt;object, object&gt;();

            dict.Add(new KeyValuePair&lt;MyClass,object&gt;(new MyClass(1, 1), 1), 1);

            //here we get the exception -- an item with the same key was already added
            //but how did it figure out the hash code?
            dict.Add(new KeyValuePair&lt;MyClass,object&gt;(new MyClass(1, 2), 1), 1); 

            return;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong> I think I've found an explanation for this as stated below in my answer. The main outcomes of it are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be careful with your keys and their hash codes :-)</li>
<li>For complicated dictionary keys you must override Equals() and GetHashCode() correctly.</li>

<li><p>Xcode: doesn't feel as good as VisualStudio or Eclipse, the two environments I'm familiar with. I think I could get used to it but I'm wondering if Apple wouldn't be better off with Eclipse. Before I found the setting where all the windows are stuck together I hated it, now I can tolerate it.</p></li>
<li><p>iPhone SDK: strange indeed. I understand Apple's desire to control their environment but in this day and age it just seems a little sleazy and they are missing out on so much by destroying developer goodwill.</p></li>
<li><p>Objective-C: I've known about it for years but never even took a look at it. The syntax is off-putting but I'm actually very intrigued by the language. I think it's an interesting third leg between C++ and C#, both of which I like a lot. Is there any chance Obj-C will break out of the Mac sandbox due to the uptick in the popularity of Apple technology?</p></li>

Yet with all the talk of refactoring code for maintainability I have not heard much of refactoring outdated database schemas.  </p>

<p>What are some tips on how to transition to a better schema without breaking all the code that relies on the old one?  I will propose a specific problem I am having to illustrate my point but feel free to give advice on other techniques that have proven helpful - those will likely come in handy as well.</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>My example:</p>

<p>My company receives and ships products.  Now a product receipt and a product shipment have some very different data associated with them so the original database designers created a separate table for receipts and for shipments.  </p>

<p>In my one year working with this system I have come to the realization that the current schema doesn't make a lick of sense.  After all, both a receipt and a shipment are basically a transaction, they each involve changing the amount of a product, at heart only the +/- sign is different.  Indeed, we frequently need to find the total amount that the product has changed over a period of time, a problem for which this design is downright intractable.  </p>

<p>Obviously the appropriate design would be to have a single Transactions table with the Id being a foreign key of either a ReceiptInfo or a ShipmentInfo table.  Unfortunately, the wrong schema has already been in production for some years and has hundreds of stored procedures, and thousands of lines of code written off of it.  How then can I transition the schema to work correctly?</p>

<ul>
<li>for performance reasons - exceptions are expensive</li>
<li>for usability reasons - the debugger pops up </li>
<li>for design reasons - the expected is not exceptional</li>

<p>In other words the code:</p>

<p>I would try using RegEx, but since the guid can be parenthesis wrapped, brace wrapped, none wrapped, makes it hard. </p>

<p>Additionally, I thought certain Guid values are invalid(?)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update 1</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/104850/c-test-if-string-is-a-guid-without-throwing-exceptions#137829"">ChristianK</a> had a good idea to catch only <code>FormatException</code>, rather than all. Changed the question's code sample to include suggestion.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>

<p>Why worry about thrown exceptions? Am I really expecting invalid GUIDs all that often? </p>

<p>The answer is <em>yes</em>. That is why I am using TryStrToGuid - I <strong>am</strong> expecting bad data.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong> <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc144096%28VS.85%29.aspx"">Namespace extensions can be specified by appending a GUID to a folder name</a>. I might be parsing folder names, checking to see if the text after the final <strong>.</strong> is a GUID.</p>

c:\Users.old
c:\UserManager.{CE7F5AA5-6832-43FE-BAE1-80D14CD8F666}
c:\Windows
c:\Windows.old
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong> I might be running a heavily used web-server wants to check the validity of some posted back data. I don't want invalid data tying up resources 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than it needs to be.</p>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong> I might be parsing a search expression entered by a user. </p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ghb12.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>If they enter GUID's I want to process them specially (such as specifically searching for that object, or highlight and format that specific search term in the response text.)</p>

<p>I read an article by Rocky Lhotka (.NET legend, inventor of CSLA, etc) where he mentioned, almost in passing, that last year he felt very terribly overwheled by the rate of change. He made it sound like maybe it wasn't possible to stay on the bleeding edge anymore, that maybe he wasn't going to try so hard because it was futile. </p>

<p>It was a surprise to me that true geniuses like Lhotka (who are probably expected to devote a great deal of their time to playing with the latest technology and should be able to pick things up quickly) also feel the burn!</p>

<p>So, how do you guys deal with this? Do you just chalk it up to the fact that development is vast, and it's more important to be able to find things quickly than to learn it all? Or do you have a continuing education strategy that actually allows you to stay close to the cutting edge?</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; unicode(text, 'utf-8')
u'\xe1'

<p><code>unicode(r)</code> seems to use <code>str()</code> on it, since it raises the same error as <code>unicode(text)</code> above:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; unicode(r)

<p>Until now everything is as planned!</p>

<p><strong>But as no one would ever expect, <code>unicode(r, 'utf-8')</code> won't even try:</strong></p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; unicode(r, 'utf-8')

Although I started out by just hacking around, I figure it'll be better in the long run if I set up a proper unit test suite before going too much further.  I've created a seperate test-runner executable as a sub project, and the tests I've added to it appear to function properly.  So far, success.</p>

<p>However, I'd really like to get my unit tests running every time I build, not only when I explicitly run them.  This will be especially true as I split up the mess I've made into convenience libraries, each of which will probably have its own test executable.  Rather than run them all by hand, I'd like to get them to run as the final step in my build process.  I've looked all through the options in the project menu and the automake manager, but I can't figure out how to set this up.</p>

<p>I imagine this could probably be done by editing the makefile by hand.  Unfortunately, my makefile-fu is a bit weak, and I'm also afraid that KDevelop might overwrite any changes I make by hand the next time I change something through the IDE.  Therefore, if there's an option on how to do this through KDevelop itself, I'd much prefer to go that way.</p>

<p>Does anybody know how I could get KDevelop to run my test executables as part of the build process?  Thank you!</p>

<p>(I'm not 100% tied to KDevelop.  If KDevelop can't do this, or else if there's an IDE that makes this much easier, I could be convinced to switch.)</p>

<p>I'm looking for a way to parse a number of XML files in a particular directory with ASP.NET (C#). I'd like to be able to return content from particular elements, but before that, need to find those that have a certain value between an element.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;file&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Title 1&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;someContent&gt;Content&lt;/someContent&gt;

    &lt;someContent&gt;Content&lt;/someContent&gt;
    &lt;filter&gt;filter, different filter&lt;/filter&gt;
&lt;/file&gt;

<p>Example case 1:</p>

<p>Give me all XML that has a filter of 'filter'.</p>

<p>Example case 2:</p>

<p>Give me all XML that has a title of 'Title 1'.</p>

<p>Looking, it seems this should be possible with LINQ, but I've only seen examples on how to do this when there is one XML file, not when there are multiples, such as in this case.</p>

I have the following:</p>

<pre><code>public class ButtonForm : Form 
{
    public class TitleButton
    {
        public TitleButton() { /* does stuff here */ }
        // there's other stuff too, just thought I should point out there's
        // a default constructor.

    }
    // Other stuff here
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then my actual form that I want to use is a subclass of <code>ButtonForm</code> instead of <code>Form</code>. This all works great, Designer even picks up the new property and shows it up on the property list. I thought this would be great! It showed the collection, I could add the buttons into there and away I would go. So I opened the collection editor, added in all the objects, and lo and behold, there sitting in the designer was a picture perfect view of what I wanted.</p>

<p>This is where it starts to get ugly. For some reason or another, Designer refuses to actually generate code to create the objects and attach them to the collection, so while it looks great in Design mode, as soon as I compile and run it, it all disappears again and I'm back to square one. I'm at a total loss as to why this would happen; if the Designer can generate it well enough to get a picture perfect view of my form with the extra behaviour, why can't/won't it generate the code into the actual code file?</p>

<p>My current web environment is having capacity issues, and so I'm looking for <strong>best-practices</strong> regarding <strong>configuration tuning</strong>, determining <strong>bottlenecks</strong>, <strong>security</strong>, etc.  </p>

<p>I presently host around 400 sites, with a fair need for redundany and security, and so I've grown beyond the single-box solution - but am not at the level of a full ISP or dedicated web-hosting company.</p>

<p>Can anyone point me in the direction of some good <strong>expertise on setting up a great apache web-farm</strong> with a view to security and future expansion?</p>

<p>My web environment consists of 2 redundant MySQL servers, 2 redundant web-content servers, 2 load balancing front-end apache servers that mount the content via nfs and share apache config and sessions directories between them, and a single ""developer's"" server which also mounts the web-content via nfs, and contains all the developer accounts. </p>

<p>I'm pretty happy with alot of this setup, but it seems to be choking on the load prematurely.</p>

<p>Thanks!!</p>

<p>--UPDATE--</p>

<p>Turns out the ""choking on the load"" is related to <code>mod_log_sql</code>, which I use to send my apache logs to a mysql database.  By re-configuring the webservers to write their sql statements to a disk file, and then creating a separate process to submit those to the database it allows the webservers to free up their threads much quicker, and handle a much greater load.</p>

Simply bubbling these errors up to a UI and displaying them will usually achieve nothing except frustration for an end user.</p>

<p>I have recently employed a basic technique for reporting errors such as this whereby I catch the error and at least add some user friendly text so that at least the end user understands what failed.</p>

<p>To do this I am catching an exception within each specific function (say for example a fetch function in a data access layer), then raising a new error with user friendly text about the function that has failed and probably cause, but then embedding the original exception in the new exception as the ""inner exception"" of that new exception. </p>

<p>This can then occur at each layer if necessary, each consumer of the lower level function adding it's own context to the error message, so that what reaches the UI is an increasingly user friendly error message.</p>

<p>Once the error reaches the UI - if necessary - it can then iterate through the nested exceptions in order to display an error message that firstly tells the user which operation failed, but also provides a bit of technical information about what actually went wrong.</p>

<p>e.g. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""The list of customer names your
  requested could not be displayed.""</p>
  
  <p>""Obtaining the list of customers
  you requested failed due to an error with the database.""</p>
  
  <p>""There was an error connecting to the
  database when retrieving a list of
  customers""</p>
  
  <p>""Login failed for user xx""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is this: Is this horribly inefficient (all those nested exceptions)? I suspect it is not best practice so what should I be doing to achieve the same thing - or should I in fact be trying to achieve something better?</p>

The CSS is pretty bad, but that is another question altogether.</p>

<p>What I really need help with is the best way to organize ASP.Net Themes and the CSS that lies within them. Imagine that there is a directory structure that looks something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Themes
<ul>
<li>Theme A
<ul>
<li>StyleA.css</li>
<li><em>Common.css</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Theme B
<ul>
<li>StyleB.css</li>
<li><em>Common.css</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Theme C
<ul>
<li>StyleC.css</li>
<li><em>Common.css</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Each theme has a common stylesheet in it. Unfortunately the author of those style sheets managed to change only a few things here and there in each copy of <em>Common.css</em>. Eventually I will evaluate whether or not those changes are even necessary, but some major cleanup needs to happen first. For now just assume that the changes, ever so small, are necessary for things to look right with each theme.</p>

<p>I would like to know what the best practices are for using themes while also needing some common styles across your application. I want to minimize the number of AppTurns in the page load, but I really want to consolidate common styles into one place in a way that maintains the ease of themes.</p>

1 - ORA (D,X)
2 - COP b

<p>I have an application base that recently replaced a second application base.  My problem is a number of users still access the old context.  I would like to serve the, now common, application from a single appBase yet accessed via either context.  I took a swing at the low lying fruit and used a symbolic link in the 'webapps' directory... pointing the old context path at the new context path; it works, but feels ""cheezy.""  And I don't like that a database connection pool is created for both contexts ( I would like to minimize the resources for connecting to the database ).  </p>

<p>Anyway, if anyone knows of the ""proper"" way to do this I will greatly appreciate it.  I'm using Tomcat 6.0.16 - no apache front end ( I suppose URL rewrite would be nice ).</p>

<p>In a third table (<strong><code>products</code></strong>) like:</p>

make_id
model_id
...
</code></pre>

<p>My problem is creating a view for products of one specifi <strong><code>make</code></strong> inside my <code>ProductsController</code> containing just that's make models:</p>

<p>I thought this could work:</p>

<pre><code>var $uses = array('Make', 'Model');

$this-&gt;Make-&gt;id = 5; // My Make

$this-&gt;Make-&gt;find(); // Returns only the make I want with it's Models (HABTM)
$this-&gt;Model-&gt;find('list'); // Returns ALL models
$this-&gt;Make-&gt;Model-&gt;find('list'); // Returns ALL models
</code></pre>

<p>So, If I want to use the <code>list</code> to pass to my view to create radio buttons I will have to do a <code>foreach()</code> in my <strong><code>make</code></strong> array to find all models titles and create a new array and send to the view via <code>$this-&gt;set()</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$makeArray = $this-&gt;Make-&gt;find();
foreach ($makeArray['Model'] as $model) {
    $modelList[] = $model['title'];

<p>Is there any easier way to get that list without stressing the <strong><code>make</code></strong> Array. It will be a commom task to develops such scenarios in my application(s).</p>

<p>Now, a Box Item, depending on what it's being used for/the status of the item, may end up being related to a ""Shipping"" box or a ""Returns"" box.</p>

<p>A Box Item may be defective:if it is, a flag will be set in the Box Item's row (IsDefective), and the Box Item will be put in a ""Returns"" box (with other items to be returned to that vendor).  Otherwise, the Box Item will eventually be put into a ""Shipping"" box (with other items to be shipped).  (Note that Shipping and Returns boxes have their own tables: there's not one common table for all boxes... though maybe I should consider doing that if possible as a third possibility?)</p>

<p>Maybe I'm just not thinking clearly today, but I started questioning what should be done in this situation.</p>

<p>My gut tells me that I should have a separate field for each possible relation, even if only one of the relations can happen at any given time, which would make the schema for Box Items look like:</p>

<p>BoxItemID
Description
IsDefective
ShippingBoxID
ReturnBoxID
etc...</p>

<p>This would make the relations clear, but it seems wasteful (since only one of the relations will be used at any time).  So then I thought I could have just one field for the BoxID, and determine which BoxID it's referring to (a Shipping or a Returns Box ID) based on the IsDefective field:</p>

<p>BoxItemID
Description
IsDefective
BoxID
etc...</p>

<p>This seems less wasteful, but doesn't sit right with me.  The relation isn't obvious.</p>

<p>So, I put it to you, database gurus of Stackoverflow.  What would you do in this situation?</p>

<p>EDIT: Thank you everyone for your input!  It's given me a lot to think about.  For one, I'm going to use an ORM next time I start a project like this. =)  For two, since I'm not right now, I'll bite the four bytes and use two fields.</p>

That said, blacklisting seems to me to be an efficient mechanism to stop a persistent attacker, given that the actual list of IP's is determined dynamically, based on application's feedback and user behavior. </p>

<p>For example:
- someone trying to brute-force your login screen
- a poorly written bot issues very strange HTTP requests to your site
- a script-kiddie uses a scanner to look for vulnerabilities in your app</p>

<p>I'm wondering if the following mechanism would work, and if so, do you know if there are any tools that do it: </p>

<ul>
<li>In a web application, developer has a hook to report an ""offense"". An offense can be minor (invalid password) and it would take dozens of such offenses to get blacklisted; or it can be major, and a couple of such offenses in a 24-hour period kicks you out. </li>
<li>Some form of a web-server-level block kicks in on before every page is loaded, and determines if the user comes from a ""bad"" IP. </li>
<li>There's a ""forgiveness"" mechanism built-in: offenses no longer count against an IP after a while.</li>

<pre><code>
class A
{
public:
    A(int whichFoo);
    int foo1();
    int foo2();
    int foo3();
    int callFoo(); // cals one of the foo's depending on the value of whichFoo
};
</code></pre>

<p>In my current implementation I save the value of <code>whichFoo</code> in a data member in the constructor and use a <code>switch</code> in <code>callFoo()</code> to decide which of the foo's to call.  Alternatively, I can use a <code>switch</code> in the constructor to save a pointer to the right <code>fooN()</code> to be called in <code>callFoo()</code>. </p>

<p>My question is which way is more efficient if an object of class A is only constructed once, while <code>callFoo()</code> is called a very large number of times.  So in the first case we have multiple executions of a switch statement, while in the second there is only one switch, and multiple calls of a member function using the pointer to it.  I know that calling a member function using a pointer is slower than just calling it directly.  Does anybody know if this overhead is more or less than the cost of a <code>switch</code>?</p>

<p>Clarification:  I realize that you never really know which approach gives better performance until you try it and time it.  However, in this case I already have approach 1 implemented, and I wanted to find out if approach 2 can be more efficient at least in principle.  It appears that it can be, and now it makes sense for me to bother to implement it and try it.  </p>

<p>Oh, and I also like approach 2 better for aesthetic reasons.  I guess I am looking for a justification to implement it. :) </p>

<p>Addresses in the list will be stored in a database table.  Separate parts have separate fields (we have fields for postal code, city name, etc.) so it is not just a giant <code>varchar</code>.  These are user-entered and due to the nature of the system may not always be complete (some may be missing postal code and others may have little more than city and state).</p>

<p>Though this is for an intranet application I have no problems using outside resources including accessing internet web services and such.  I'd actually prefer that over rolling my own unless it would be trivial to do myself.  If Google or Yahoo! already provides a free service, I'm more than willing to check it out.  The keyword is it must be free, as I'm not at liberty to introduce any additional cost onto this project for this feature as it is already a bonus ""perk"" so to speak.</p>

<p>I'm thinking of this much like many brick &amp; mortar shops do their ""Find a Location"" feature.  Showing it in a simple table sorted appropriately and displaying distance (in, say, miles) is great.  Showing a map mash-up is even cooler, but I can definitely live with just getting the distance back and me handling all of the subsequent display and sorting.</p>

<p>The problem with simple distance algorithms is the nature of the data.  Since all or part of the address can be undefined, I don't have anything convenient like lat/long coords.  Also, even if I make postal codes required, 90% of the addresses will probably have the same five postal codes.</p>

<p>While it need not be blisteringly fast, anything that takes more than seven seconds to show up on the page due to latency might be too long for the average user to wait, as we know.  If such a hypothetical service supports sending a batch of addresses at once instead of querying one at a time, that'd be great.  Still, I should not think the list of addresses would exceed 50 total, if that many.</p>

The problem is, once a certain number of threads are created in a single thread group, the operating system is unwilling or unable to create any more.</p>

<p>This seems to be specific to Java creating threads, as the C thread-limit program was able to create about 1.5k threads. Additionally, this doesn't happen with a Java 1.4 JVM... it can create over 1.4k threads, though they are obviously being handled differently with respect to the OS.</p>

<p>In this case, the number of threads it's cutting off at is a mere 29 threads. This is testable with a simple Java program that just creates threads until it gets an error and then prints the number of threads it created. The error is a <pre>java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread</pre></p>

<p>This seems to be unaffected by things such as the number of threads in use by other processes or users or the total amount of memory the system is using at the time. JVM settings like Xms, Xmx, and Xss don't seem to change anything either (which is expected, considering the issue seems to be with native OS thread creation).</p>

<p>The output of ""ulimit -a"" is as follows:</p>

<pre>
core file size        (blocks, -c) 0
data seg size         (kbytes, -d) unlimited
file size             (blocks, -f) unlimited
max locked memory     (kbytes, -l) 4
max memory size       (kbytes, -m) unlimited

pipe size          (512 bytes, -p) 8

max user processes            (-u) 7168
virtual memory        (kbytes, -v) unlimited
</pre>

<p>The user process limit does not seem to be the issue. Searching for information on what could be wrong has not turned up much, but <a href=""http://blogs.oracle.com/gverma/2008/03/redhat_linux_kernels_and_proce_1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this post</a> seems to indicate that at least some Red Hat kernels limit a process to 300 MB of memory allocated for stack, and at 10 MB per thread for stack, it seems like the issue could be there (though it seems strange and unlikely as well).</p>

<p>I've tried changing the stack size with ""ulimit -s"" to test this, but any value other than 10240 and the JVM does not start with an error of:</p>

<pre>Error occurred during initialization of VM
Cannot create VM thread. Out of system resources.</pre>

<p>I can generally get around Linux, but I really don't know much about system configuration, and I haven't been able to find anything specifically addressing this kind of situation. Any ideas on what system or JVM settings could be causing this would be appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Edits</strong>: Running the thread-limit program mentioned by <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/116640/low-single-process-thread-limit-in-red-hat-linux#116696"">plinth</a>, there was no failure until it tried to create the 1529th thread.</p>

<p>The issue also did not occur using a 1.4 JVM (does occur with 1.6.0_02 and 1.6.0_04 JVMs, can't test with a 1.5 JVM at the moment).</p>

<p>The code for the thread test I'm using is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public class ThreadTest {

   public static void main(String[] pArgs) throws Exception {

      try {
         // keep spawning new threads forever
         while (true) {
            new TestThread().start();
         }
      }
      // when out of memory error is reached, print out the number of
      // successful threads spawned and exit
      catch ( OutOfMemoryError e ) {
         System.out.println(TestThread.CREATE_COUNT);
         System.exit(-1);
      }
   }

   static class TestThread extends Thread {
      private static int CREATE_COUNT = 0;
      public TestThread() {
         CREATE_COUNT++;
      }
      // make the thread wait for eternity after being spawned
      public void run() {
         try {
            sleep(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
         }
         // even if there is an interruption, dont do anything
         catch (InterruptedException e) {
         }
      }
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you run this with a 1.4 JVM it will hang when it can't create any more threads and require a kill -9 (at least it did for me).</p>

<p><strong>More Edit:</strong></p>

<p>It turns out that the system that is having the problem is using the LinuxThreads threading model while another system that works fine is using the NPTL model. </p>

This looks like not the best solution, because if I sleep for long period then unwanted delay is added, if I sleep for short period then it can affect performance.</p>

<p>I could try using </p>

<pre><code>new CountDownLatch(1)
</code></pre>

<p>and decrease countdown when task is complete and do </p>

<pre><code>countdown.await()
</code></pre>

<p>, but I found it possible only if I control Future creation. It is possible, but requires system redesign, because currently logic of tasks creation (sending Callable to ExecutorService) is separated from decision to wait for which Future. I could also override </p>

<pre><code>&lt;T&gt; RunnableFuture&lt;T&gt; AbstractExecutorService.newTaskFor(Callable&lt;T&gt; callable)
</code></pre>

<p>and create custom implementation of RunnableFuture with ability to attach listener to be notified when task is finished, then attach such listener to needed tasks and use CountDownLatch, but that means I have to override newTaskFor for every ExecutorService I use - and potentially there will be implementation which do not extend AbstractExecutorService. I could also try wrapping given ExecutorService for same purpose, but then I have to decorate all methods producing Futures.</p>

<p>All these solutions may work but seem very unnatural. It looks like I'm missing something simple, like </p>

<pre><code>WaitHandle.WaitAny(WaitHandle[] waitHandles)
</code></pre>

<p>in c#. Are there any well known solutions for such kind of problem?</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>Originally I did not have access to Future creation at all, so there were no elegant solution. After redesigning system I got access to Future creation and was able to add countDownLatch.countdown() to execution process, then I can countDownLatch.await() and everything works fine.
Thanks for other answers, I did not know about ExecutorCompletionService and it indeed can be helpful in similar tasks, but in this particular case it could not be used because some Futures are created without any executor - actual task is sent to another server via network, completes remotely and completion notification is received.</p>

<p>In the past, I've run into issues where, although we had all the source code, building an old version of the product was an exercise in scurrying around trying to get the exact correct configuration of Visual Studio, InstallShield and other tools (including the correct patch version) used to build the product.  On my next project, I'd like to avoid this by checking these build tools into source control, and then build using them. This would also simplify things in terms of setting up a new build machine -- 1) install our source control tool, 2) point at the right branch, and 3) build -- that's it.</p>

<p>Options I've considered include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Copying the install CD ISO to source control - although this provides the backup we need if we have to go back to an older version, it isn't a good option for ""live"" use (each build would need to start with an install step, which could easily turn a 1 hour build into 3 hours).</li>
<li>Installing the software to source control.  ClearCase maps your branch to a drive letter; we could install the software under this drive.  This doesn't take into account non-file part of installing your tools, like registry settings.</li>
<li>Installing all the software and setting up the build process inside a virtual machine, storing the virtual machine in source control, and figuring out how to get the VM to do a build on boot.  While we capture the state of the ""build machine"" with ease, we get the overhead of a VM, and it doesn't help with the ""make the same tools available to developers issue.""</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems such a basic idea of configuration management, but I've been unable to track down any resources for how to do this.  What are the suggestions?</p>

<p>Lets say we are implementing an employee management application using EJB.</p>

<p>Now, there are 2 ways of doing this.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Normally, we create entities (POJOs) which represent an employee. Then we create an EJB interface 'EmployeeManager' with add, delete, update, retrieve, retrieveAll methods. This way I could use 'employee' entity as a data transfer object.</p></li>
<li><p>We call the EJB interface itself 'Employee'. Implementation could be called 'EmployeeImpl' which has <em>fields</em> as well as method implementation (add, delete, update, retrieve, retrieveAll). If I am using a layered approach where my business logic needs access to employee details, I need to pass 'EmployeeImpl' (because it contains values).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Which one do you think is the better way?</p>

<p>I prefer the first one, because it 'looks' fine and does not feel awkward. like</p>

<pre><code>EmployeeMgr empMgr = // JNDI lookup;
Employee emp = new Employee();
empMgr.add(emp);
Employee employees[] = empMgr.retrieveAll();

<p>Where as the second one would look like (though I am not sure),</p>

<pre><code>Employee emp = // JNDI lookup;
emp.setName(); //set the properties
emp.add();
Employee employees[] = emp.retrieveAll();

<p>So I have a C# program that I have running in the background with an icon in the SystemTray.  I have a low level keyboard hook so when I press two keys (Ctr+windows in this case) it'll pull of the application's main form.  The form is set to be full screen in the combo key press even handler:</p>

<pre><code>this.FormBorderStyle = FormBorderStyle.None;
this.WindowState = FormWindowState.Maximized;
</code></pre>

<p>So it basically works.  When I hit CTR+Windows it brings up the form, no matter what program I have given focus to.  But sometimes, the taskbar will still show up over the form, which I don't want.  I want it to always be full screen when I hit that key combo.</p>

<p>I figure it has something to do with what application has focus originally.  But even when I click on my main form, the taskbar sometimes stays there.  So I wonder if focus really is the problem.  It just seems like sometimes the taskbar is being stubborn and doesn't want to sit behind my program.</p>

<p>Anyone have any ideas how I can fix this?</p>

<p>EDIT:  More details-
I'm trying to achieve the same effect that a web browser has when you put it into fullscreen mode, or when you put powerpoint into presentation mode.</p>

<p>In a windows form you do that by putting the border style to none and maximizing the window.  But sometimes the window won't cover the taskbar for some reason.  Half the time it will.</p>

<p>If I have the main window topmost, the others will fall behind it when I click on it, which I don't want if the taskbar is hidden.</p>

1412,118540,,2008-09-23T01:04:10Z,,0,What is wrong with my snap to grid code?,"<p>First of all, I'm fairly sure snapping to grid is fairly easy, however I've run into some odd trouble in this situation and my maths are too weak to work out specifically what is wrong.</p>

<p>Here's the situation</p>

<p>I have an abstract concept of a grid, with Y steps exactly Y_STEP apart (the x steps are working fine so ignore them for now)</p>

<p>The grid is in an abstract coordinate space, and to get things to line up I've got a magic offset in there, let's call it Y_OFFSET</p>

<p>to snap to the grid I've got the following code (python)</p>

<pre><code>def snapToGrid(originalPos, offset, step):
    index = int((originalPos - offset) / step) #truncates the remainder away
    return index * gap + offset
</code></pre>

<p>so I pass the cursor position, Y_OFFSET and Y_STEP into that function and it returns me the nearest floored y position on the grid</p>

<p>That appears to work fine in the original scenario, however when I take into account the fact that the view is scrollable things get a little weird.</p>

<p>Scrolling is made as basic as I can get it, I've got a viewPort that keeps count of the distance scrolled along the Y Axis and just offsets everything that goes through it.</p>

<p>Here's a snippet of the cursor's mouseMotion code:</p>

<pre><code>def mouseMotion(self, event):
    pixelPos = event.pos[Y]
    odePos = Scroll.pixelPosToOdePos(pixelPos)
    self.tool.positionChanged(odePos)
</code></pre>

<p>So there's two things to look at there, first the Scroll module's translation from pixel position to the abstract coordinate space, then the tool's positionChanged function which takes the abstract coordinate space value and snaps to the nearest Y step.</p>

<p>Here's the relevant Scroll code</p>

<pre><code>def pixelPosToOdePos(pixelPos):
    offsetPixelPos = pixelPos - self.viewPortOffset
    return pixelsToOde(offsetPixelPos)

def pixelsToOde(pixels):
    return float(pixels) / float(pixels_in_an_ode_unit)
</code></pre>

<p>And the tools update code</p>

<pre><code>def positionChanged(self, newPos):
    self.snappedPos = snapToGrid(originalPos, Y_OFFSET, Y_STEP)
</code></pre>

<p>The last relevant chunk is when the tool goes to render itself.  It goes through the Scroll object, which transforms the tool's snapped coordinate space position into an onscreen pixel position, here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>#in Tool
def render(self, screen):
    Scroll.render(screen, self.image, self.snappedPos)

#in Scroll
def render(self, screen, image, odePos):
    pixelPos = self.odePosToPixelPos(odePos)
    screen.blit(image, pixelPos) # screen is a surface from pygame for the curious

def odePosToPixelPos(self.odePos):
    offsetPos = odePos + self.viewPortOffset
    return odeToPixels(offsetPos)

def odeToPixels(odeUnits):
    return int(odeUnits * pixels_in_an_ode_unit)
</code></pre>

<p>Whew, that was a long explanation.  Hope you're still with me... </p>

<p>The problem I'm now getting is that when I scroll up the drawn image loses alignment with the cursor.<br />
It starts snapping to the Y step exactly 1 step below the cursor.
Additionally it appears to phase in and out of allignment.<br />
At some scrolls it is out by 1 and other scrolls it is spot on.<br />
It's never out by more than 1 and it's always snapping to a valid grid location.</p>

<p>Best guess I can come up with is that somewhere I'm truncating some data in the wrong spot, but no idea where or how it ends up with this behavior.</p>

<p>Anyone familiar with coordinate spaces, scrolling and snapping?</p>

<p>My original approach was a cookie based system.  Essentially I set a cookie with an auth code, and every data access changed the cookie.  As well, whenever there was a failed authentication, all sessions by that user were de-authenticated, to keep hijackers out.  To hijack a session, somebody would have to leave themselves logged in, and a hacker would need to have the very last cookie update sent to spoof a session.</p>

The tricky part is the container for these can vary in size and I'd like to fit as many as I can in each row - in other words, I won't know beforehand how many items fit in a line, and if the page is resized the items should re-flow themselves to accommodate. E.g. initially 10 items could fit on each line, but on resize it could be reduced to 5.</p>

<p>I don't think I can use an html table since I don't know the number of columns (since I don't know how many will fit on a line). I can use css to float them, but since they're of varying size they won't line up.</p>

<p>So far the only thing I can think of is to use javascript to get the size of largest item, set the size of all items to that size, and float everything left.</p>

<p>Any better suggestions?</p>

<p>In this case, the exact matching needs to be relaxed because we assume <em>the data sources has not been rigurously checked</em> against the official bureau of identification of the country. Also we need to assume <em>typos are common</em>, because the nature of the processes to collect the data. What is more, the amount of records is around 2 or 3 millions in every source...</p>

<p>Our team had thought in something like this: first, force exact matching in selected fields like ID NUMBER, and NAMES to know how hard the problem can be. Second, relaxing the matching criteria, and count how much records more can be matched, but is here where the problem arises: <strong>how to do to relax the matching criteria without generating too noise neither restricting too much?</strong></p>

<p>What tool can be more effective to handle this?, for example, do you know about some especific extension in some database engine to support this matching?
Do you know about clever algorithms like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex"" rel=""nofollow"">soundex</a> to handle this approximate matching, but for spanish texts?</p>

I know that <a href=""http://www.postsharp.org/"">PostSharp</a> makes this possible but I find it incredibly wasteful that the developler of PostSharp basically had to rewrite the functionality of the whole <code>System.Reflection</code> namespace in order to make existing assemblies modifiable.</p>

<p><code>System.Reflection.Emit</code> only allows the creation of new, dynamic assemblies. However, all the builder classes used here inherit from the basic reflection classes (e.g. <code>TypeBuilder</code> inherits from <code>System.Type</code>). Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a way to coerce an existing, dynamically loaded type into a type builder. At least, there's no official, supported way.</p>

<p>So what about unsupported? Does anyone know of backdoors that allow to load existing assemblies or types into such builder classes?</p>

<p>Mind, I am <strong>not</strong> searching for ways to modify the current assembly (this <em>may</em> even be an unreasonable request) but just to modify existing assemblies loaded from disc. I fear there's no such thing but I'd like to ask anyway.</p>

<p>In the worst case, one would have to resort to <code>ildasm.exe</code> to disassemble the code and then to <code>ilasm.exe</code> for reassembly but there's no toolchain (read: IL reader) contained in .NET to work with IL data (or is there?).</p>

<p>/EDIT:</p>

<p>I've got no specific use case. I'm just interested in a general-purpose solution because patching existing assemblies is a quite common task. Take obfuscators for example, or profilers, or AOP libraries (yes, the latter <em>can</em> be implemented differently). As I've said, it seems incredibly wasteful to be forced to rewrite large parts of the already existing infrastructure in <code>System.Reflection</code>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>@Wedge:</h2>

<p>You're right. However, there's no specific use case here. I've modified the original question to reflect this. My interest was sparked by another question where the asker wanted to know how he could inject the instructions <code>pop</code> and <code>ret</code> at the end of every method in order to keep Lutz Roeder's Reflector from reengineering the (VB or C#) source code.</p>

<p>Now, this scenario can be realized with a number of tools, e.g. PostSharp mentioned above and the <a href=""http://sebastien.lebreton.free.fr/reflexil/"">Reflexil</a> plugin for Reflector, that, in turn, uses the <a href=""http://www.mono-project.com/Cecil"">Cecil</a> library.</p>

<p>All in all, I'm just not satisfied with the .NET framework.</p>

<h2>@Joel:</h2>

<p>Yes, I'm aware of this limitation. Thanks anyway for pointing it out, since it's important.</p>

<h2>@marxidad:</h2>

<p>This seems like the only feasible approach. However, this would mean that you'd still have to recreate the complete assembly using the builder classes, right? I.e. you'd have to walk over the whole assembly manually.</p>

<p>Hmm, I'll look into that.</p>

(Some of the points refer to limitations of Rhino Mocks, a mocking framework for C#, but the rules may apply more generally as well.)  Does anyone have any best practices that they follow?</p>

<p>To maximize the testability of code, follow these rules:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Write the test first, then the code.</strong> Reason: This ensures that you write testable code and that every line of code gets tests written for it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Design classes using dependency injection.</strong> Reason: You cannot mock or test what cannot be seen.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Separate UI code from its behavior using Model-View-Controller or Model-View-Presenter.</strong> Reason: Allows the business logic to be tested while the parts that can't be tested (the UI) is minimized.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Do not write static methods or classes.</strong>  Reason: Static methods are difficult or impossible to isolate and Rhino Mocks is unable to mock them.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Program off interfaces, not classes.</strong> Reason: Using interfaces clarifies the relationships between objects. An interface should define a service that an object needs from its environment.  Also, interfaces can be easily mocked using Rhino Mocks and other mocking frameworks.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Isolate external dependencies.</strong> Reason: Unresolved external dependencies cannot be tested.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mark as virtual the methods you intend to mock.</strong> Reason: Rhino Mocks is unable to mock non-virtual methods.</p></li>

As I'm just a hobbyist, not a pro, I'd prefer to use .NET as that's what I know best. I do realize that some of this stuff might require something more than what I could do in C#.</p>

<p>I have seen some applications that are able to extend the common dialog box (specifically for Save As.. and File Open) either by adding buttons to the toolbar (eg: <a href=""http://www.win-utilities.com/dba/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Dialog Box Assistant</a>) or by putting extra buttons in the title bar beside the minimize, maximize, and/or close buttons. Either would be good option though I don't have the foggiest idea where to begin.</p>

<p>One approach I've tried is to 'drag' the folder name from an app I wrote to the file name textbox on the dialog box, highlighting it using a mouse hook technique I picked up from Corneliu Tusnea's <a href=""http://readify.net/tech-zone/tech-tools/hawkeye-the-net-runtime-object-editor/Default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Hawkeye Runtime Object Editor</a>, and then prepending the path name by pinvoking SendMessage with WM_SETTEXT. It (sort of) works but feels a bit klunky.</p>

<p>Any advice on technique or implementation for this would be much appreciated. Or if there's an existing utility that already does this, please let me know!</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: When all is said and done, I think I'll probably got with an existing utility. However, I would like to know if there <em>is</em> a way to do this programmatically.</p>

1500,126350,21576,2008-09-24T10:13:16Z,,4,How to secure MS SSAS 2005 for HTTP remote access via Internet?,"<p>We are building an hosted application that uses MS SQL Server Analysis Services 2005 for some of the reporting, specifically OLAP cube browsing.  Since it is designed to be used by very large global organizations, security is important.</p>

<p>It seems that Microsoft's preferred client tool for browsing OLAP cubes is Excel 2007 and the whole infrastructure is geared around Windows Integrated Authentication.  We, however, are trying to build an internet-facing web application and do not want to create Windows Accounts for every user.</p>

<p>It also seems that there are not many nice AJAXy web-based OLAP cube browsing tools (fast, drag-and-drop for dimensions, support for actions, cross-browser etc.) As an aside, we're currently using <a href=""http://www.dundas.com/Products/Chart/NET/OLAP/index.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Dundas OLAP Grid</a> but have also considered <a href=""http://www.radar-soft.com/products/radaraspnet_MSAS.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">RadarCube</a> and other more expensive commercial solutions and are still thinking of taking on <a href=""http://www.sqlserveranalysisservices.com/cellsetgrid/cellsetgridintro.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">CellSetGrid</a> and developing it further - if you know of any other cheap/open solutions please let me know!</p>

<p>We are therefore planning on providing two modes of access to the cube data:</p>

<ol>
<li>Through our own Web Application using one of these 3rd party Web-based OLAP browsing tools. </li>
<li>Direct access from Excel over HTTPS via the msmdpump.dll data pump, for when the web version is too slow/clunky or user needs more powerful analysis.</li>
</ol>

<p>For the web app access, the connection to the SSAS data source happens from the web server so we can happily pass a CustomData item on the Connection String which indicates which user is connecting.  Since we potentially have too many combinations of rights to create individual SSAS roles for, we have implemented <strong>dynamic dimension security</strong> that uses a ""Cube Users"" dimension in conjunction with the CustomData item from the connection string and limits the Allowed Set of various other dimension members accordingly (via other Many-to-Many dinemsion relationships with Measure Groups that contain the 'rights mapping')</p>

<p>See Mosha on Dimension Security:
<a href=""http://www.sqljunkies.com/WebLog/mosha/archive/2004/12/16/5605.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sqljunkies.com/WebLog/mosha/archive/2004/12/16/5605.aspx</a></p>

<p>This all seems to work fine so far.</p>

<p>For the 'direct connection' from Excel, we set up the data pump for HTTP access
(see the <a href=""http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/sql/2005/httpasws.mspx"" rel=""nofollow"">MS Technet article</a>) but have enabled anonymous access, relying again on the Connection String to control access since we don't have windows accounts.
However, in this case, the connection string is controlled by the user (we push a .odc file from the web app, but a curious user could view &amp; change it), so we cannot rely on users to be good and keep the CustomData=grunt@corp.org from changing to CustomData=superuser@corp.org.  As it turns out, this also causes the same problem with Roles, since these are also specified on the connection string if you are <strong>not</strong> using Windows Integrated Authentication.</p>

<p>The question therefore boils down to this: is there a way of getting basic authentication in IIS working without windows accounts in such a way that it can be used with the SSAS data pump to let SSAS know which user is connecting so that dynamic dimension security can be used successfully?</p>

<p>(This is my first q on StackOverflow and probably the most complicated question I've ever asked: let me know where I haven't explained myself very well and I'll attempt to clarify)</p>

I want to lookup a value, if the class contains the value then use it and modify a property of the class.  I am concerned about the design of the public interface.<br />
Here is how the class is going to be used:</p>

<pre>
ClassItem *pClassItem = myClass.Lookup(value);
if (pClassItem)
{ // item is found in class so modify and use it 
  pClassItem->SetAttribute(something);
  ... // use myClass
}
else
{  // value doesn't exist in the class so add it
  myClass.Add(value, something); 
}
</pre>

<p>However I don't want to have to expose ClassItem to this client (ClassItem is an implementation detail of MyClass).
To get round that the following could be considered:</p>

<pre>
bool found = myClass.Lookup(value);
if (found)
{ // item is found in class so modify and use it 
  myClass.ModifyAttribute(value, something);
  ... // use myClass
}
else
{  // value doesn't exist in the class so add it
  myClass.Add(value, something); 
}
</pre>

<p>However this is inefficient as Modify will have to do the lookup again.  This would suggest a lookupAndModify type of method:</p>

<pre>
bool found = myClass.LookupAndModify(value, something);
if (found)
{ // item is found in class
  ... // use myClass
}
else
{  // value doesn't exist in the class so add it
  myClass.Add(value, something); 
}
</pre>

<p>But rolling LookupAndModify into one method seems like very poor design.  It also only modifies if value is found and so the name is not only cumbersome but misleading as well.</p>

<p>Is there another better design that gets round this issue?  Any design patterns for this (I couldn't find anything through google)?</p>

<p>But I do have a little question about the coding style of if/else control block used by the tutorial.</p>

<p>In the wikibook, the code look like the following:</p>

<pre><code>doGuessing num = do
   putStrLn ""Enter your guess:""
   guess &lt;- getLine
   if (read guess) &lt; num
     then do putStrLn ""Too low!""
             doGuessing num
     else if (read guess) &gt; num
            then do putStrLn ""Too high!""
                    doGuessing num
            else do putStrLn ""You Win!""
</code></pre>

<p>It makes me confusing, because this coding style is totally volate ""Good Coding Style"" in C-sytnax like programming language, where we should ident if/else if/else at same column.</p>

<p>I know it just not work in Haskell, because it would cause parse error if I ident ""else"" at same column of ""if"".</p>

<p>But what about the following one? I think it is much more clear then the above one. But since the above is used by Wikibook and Yet Another Haskell Tutorial, which marked ""best tutorial available online"" at offical Haskell website, so I'm not sure whether this coding style is a convention in Haskell programs.</p>

<pre><code>doGuessing num = do
    putStrLn ""Enter your guess:""
    guess &lt;- getLine
    if (read guess) &lt; num then

<blockquote>
  <p>For every change you make to the
  database, you write a new migration.
  Migrations typically have two methods:
  an ""up"" method in which the changes
  are applied and a ""down"" method in
  which the changes are undone. A single
  command brings the database up to
  date, and can also be used to bring
  the database to a specific version of
  the schema.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My question is the following: Is every DDL command in an ""up"" method reversible? In other words, can we always provide a ""down"" method? Can you imagine any DDL command that can not be ""down""ed? </p>

<p>Please, do not consider the typical data migration problem where during the ""up"" method we have loss of data: e.g. changing a field type from <code>datetime</code> (<code>DateOfBirth</code>) to <code>int</code> (<code>YearOfBirth</code>) we are losing data that can not be restored.</p>

<p>now i have a different point of view(camera) for this plane. i mean i have a different camera that will look at this plane from a different point of view. From that camera point of view these points have different locations. for example (x0,y0,z0) will be (x0',y0')

<p>Do you know the coefficients of the plane-equation and the camera positions (along with the projection), or do you only have the six points?  - Nils</p>

<p>i know the location of first 3 points. therefore we can calculate the coefficients of the plane. so we know exactly where the plane is from (0,0,0) point of view. and then we have the camera that can only see the points! So the only thing that camera sees is 3 points and also it knows their locations in 3d space (and for sure their locations on 2d camera view plane). and after all i want to look at camera view, pick a point (for example (x1,y1)) and tell where is that point on that plane. (for sure this (X,Y,Z) point should fit on the plane equation). Also i know nothing about the camera location.</p>

I figured that the advantages in this are making the program more tidy (file system - wise) and reducing (un)installation time. During the runtime of the application, the entire image strip is allocated and copied from FS to RAM.

I've added a web service to this applciation to provide the upload/download functionality that way but I'm not too sure on how well my implementation is going to cope with large files.</p>

<p>At the moment the definitions of the upload &amp; download methods look like this (written using Apache CXF):</p>

<pre><code>boolean uploadFile(@WebParam(name = ""username"") String username,
    @WebParam(name = ""password"") String password,
    @WebParam(name = ""filename"") String filename,
    @WebParam(name = ""fileContents"") byte[] fileContents)

byte[] downloadFile(@WebParam(name = ""username"") String username,
    @WebParam(name = ""password"") String password,
    @WebParam(name = ""filename"") String filename) throws DownloadException,
    LoginException;
</code></pre>

<p>So the file gets uploaded and downloaded as a byte array.  But if I have a file of some stupid size (e.g. 1GB) surely this will try and put all that information into memory and crash my service.</p>

<p>So my question is - is it possible to return some kind of stream instead?  I would imagine this isn't going to be terribly OS independent though.  Although I know the theory behind web services, the practical side is something that I still need to pick up a bit of information on.</p>

1585,132750,22113,2008-09-25T11:37:04Z,,4,jQuery - running a function on a new image,"<p>I'm a jQuery novice, so the answer to this may be quite simple:</p>

<p>I have an image, and I would like to do several things with it.
When a user clicks on a 'Zoom' icon, I'm running the 'imagetool' plugin (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/jquery-imagetool/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/jquery-imagetool/</a>) to load a larger version of the image. The plugin creates a new div around the image and allows the user to pan around.</p>

<p>When a user clicks on an alternative image, I'm removing the old one and loading in the new one.</p>

<p>The problem comes when a user clicks an alternative image, and then clicks on the zoom button - the imagetool plugin creates the new div, but the image appears after it...</p>

<p>The code is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>// Product Zoom (jQuery)
$(document).ready(function(){
$(""#productZoom"").click(function() {

	// Set new image src
	var imageSrc = $(""#productZoom"").attr(""href"");
	$(""#productImage"").attr('src', imageSrc);	

	// Run the imagetool plugin on the image
	$(function() {
		$(""#productImage"").imagetool({
			viewportWidth: 300,
			viewportHeight: 300,
			topX: 150,
			topY: 150,
			bottomX: 450,
			bottomY: 450
		});
	});
	return false;
});
});


// Alternative product photos (jQuery)
$(document).ready(function(){
$("".altPhoto"").click(function() {

	$('#productImageDiv div.viewport').remove();
	$('#productImage').remove();

	// Set new image src
	var altImageSrc = $(this).attr(""href"");

	$(""#productZoom"").attr('href', altImageSrc);

	var img = new Image();
    $(img).load(function () {
		$(this).hide();
        $('#productImageDiv').append(this);
        $(this).fadeIn();
    }).error(function () {
        // notify the user that the image could not be loaded
    }).attr({
		src: altImageSrc,
		id: ""productImage""
		});

	return false;		
});
});
</code></pre>

<p>It seems to me, that the imagetool plugin can no longer see the #productImage image once it has been replaced with a new image... So I think this has something to do with binding? As in because the new image is added to the dom after the page has loaded, the iamgetool plugin can no longer use it correctly... is this right?
If so, any ideas how to deal with it?</p>

Do you know an easy pattern to correctly dispose such variables?</p>

<p>What we used before ThreadStatic is a ThreadContextManager. Every thread was allocated a ThreadContext which retained all thread-specific information. We spawned some threads and let them work. Then, when they all finished, we disposed of the ThreadContentManager, which in turn disposed all the contexts if they were IDisposable.</p>

<p>I don't see an immediate way to translate this pattern to ThreadStatic objects. The objects will be disposed of eventualy, because the threads die, and so nothing reference them. However, we prefer deterministic dispose whenever possible.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I do not really control the threads directly - I'm using Microsoft CCR, which has a ThreadPool that does tasks. When all the tasks are done, I'm disposing the Dispatcher (which holds the threadpool). The thing is - I do not get a chance to do anything ""at the end of a thread's main function"" - so I can't dispose things manually at the end of a thread's run. Can I access the thread's static objects from outside the thread somehow?</p>

Data generally comes from the database and when it doesn't, the process involved in setting it/storing it is generally hidden in the code. With the database you can generally see all the data available to you and the ways with which it relates to other data.</p>

<p>Sometimes for really small sets of data I just store them in an internal data structure in the code (like A Perl hash) but then when a change is needed, it's in the hands of a developer. </p>

<p>So how do you handle small sets of infrequently changed data? Do you have set criteria of when to use a database table or a text file or..? </p>

<p>I'm tempted to just use a database table for absolutely everything but I'm not sure if there are any implications to this.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> For context:</p>

<p>I've been asked to put a new contact form on the website for a handful of companies, with more to be added occasionally in the future. Except, companies don't have contact email addresses.. the users inside these companies do (as they post jobs through their own accounts). Now though, we want a ""speculative application"" type functionality and the form needs an email address to send these applications to. But we also don't want to put an email address as a property in the form or else spammers can just use it as an open email gateway. So clearly, we need an ID -> contact_email type relationship with companies.  </p>

<p>SO, I can either add a column to a table with millions of rows which will be used, literally, about 20 times OR create a new table that at most is going to hold about 20 rows. Typically how we handle this in the past is just to create a nasty text file and read it from there. But this creates maintenance nightmares and these text files are frequently looked over when data that they depend on changes. Perhaps this is a fault with the process, but I'm just interested in hearing views on this.</p>

All of the workbooks will share a number of class libraries and third party assemblies, in fact most of the work is done in the class libraries.  I currently have my folder structure laid out like this.</p>

<pre><code>Base
    Libraries  
    Assemblies  
    Workbooks  
        Workbook1  
        Workbook2
</code></pre>

<p>Each of the workbooks will be its own solution, and the workbook solutions just reference the assemblies in the folder structure.  My question is how would you lay out the source control?  Would you start the repository at the base? Or would you create a repository for each workbook solution?  Would you rearrange the folders?    </p>

<p>Now that we have the initial development done, we're about to have a bunch of outside developers come on to the project to helps us convert the rest of the workbooks and I really like the idea of them being able to check out from the base directory and having all of the dependencies ready to go.  I also worry that there are other concerns that come with having 20+ solutions/projects under one source control repository.  </p>

<p>I want everything to be as simple as possible for people joining the project but I don't want to sacrifice long term usability.  In my mind I've been going back and forth, what's simpler one repository or one repository per solution?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It seems like every time I mark something as const, I get an error and have to change some other function somewhere to be const too.  Then this causes me to have to change <em>another</em> function somewhere else.  Is this something that just gets easier with experience?</p></li>
<li><p>Are the benefits of using const <em>really</em> enough to compensate for the trouble?  If you don't intend on changing an object, why not just not write code that doesn't change it?</p></li>

(Pointed out to me, by 3 people, no less) whether or not a license allows a user to use the software in a commercial software is covered <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/137048/how-do-i-tell-if-i-can-re-use-a-free-software-library-in-a-commercial-app"">in this question</a>. But, as stated, I'm also looking if someone can shed light on the difference other than that. In context of choosing one for my own project rather than in the context of whether or not I can use the software within my own commercial software ( like I believe the other thread is about )</p>

1644,137530,369,2008-09-26T03:05:03Z,,2,Why is my stored procedure receiving a null parameter?,"<p>Ok, this is a curly one. I'm working on some Delphi code that I didn't write, and I'm encountering a very strange problem. One of my stored procedures' parameters is coming through as <code>null</code>, even though it's definitely being sent <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>The Delphi code uses a TADOQuery to execute the stored procedure (anonymized):</p>

<pre><code> ADOQuery1.SQL.Text := ""exec MyStoredProcedure :Foo,:Bar,:Baz,:Qux,:Smang,:Jimmy"";
 ADOQuery1.Parameters.ParamByName(""Foo"").Value := Integer(someFunction()); 
 // other parameters all set similarly
 ADOQuery1.ExecSQL;
</code></pre>

<p><code>Integer(SomeFunction())</code> currently always returns 1 - I checked with the debugger.</p>

<p>However, in my stored proc ( altered for debug purposes ):</p>

<pre><code>create procedure MyStoredProcedure (
    @Foo int, @Bar int, @Baz int,
    @Qux int, @Smang int, @Jimmy varchar(20) 
) as begin
    -- temp debug
    if ( @Foo is null ) begin
        insert into TempLog values ( ""oh crap"" )
    end
    -- do the rest of the stuff here..
end
</code></pre>

<p><code>TempLog</code> does indeed end up with ""oh crap"" in it (side question: there must be a better way of debugging stored procs: what is it?).</p>

<p>Here's an example trace from profiler:</p>

<pre><code>exec [MYDB]..sp_procedure_params_rowset N'MyStoredProcedure',1,NULL,NULL

declare @p3 int
set @p3=NULL
exec sp_executesql 
    N'exec MyStoredProcedure @P1,@P2,@P3,@P4,@P5,@P6',
    N'@P1 int OUTPUT,@P2 int,@P3 int,@P4 int,@P5 int,@P6 int',
    @p3 output,1,1,1,0,200
select @p3
</code></pre>

<p>This looks a little strange to me. Notice that it's using @p3 <em>and</em> @P3 - could this be causing my issue?    </p>

<p>The other strange thing is that it seems to depend on which TADOConnection I use.    </p>

<p>The project is a dll which is passed a TADOConnection from another application. It calls all the stored procedures using this connection.</p>

<p>If instead of using this connection, I first do this:</p>

<pre><code>ConnectionNew := TADOQuery.Create(ConnectionOld.Owner);
ConnectionNew.ConnectionString := ConnectionOld.ConnectionString;
TADOQuery1.Connection := ConnectionNew;
</code></pre>

<p>Then the issue does not occur! The trace from this situation is this:</p>

<pre><code>exec [MYDB]..sp_procedure_params_rowset N'MyStoredProcedure',1,NULL,NULL

declare @p1 int
set @p1=64
exec sp_prepare @p1 output,
    N'@P1 int,@P2 int,@P3 int,@P4 int,@P5 int,@P6 varchar(20)',
    N'exec MyStoredProcedure @P1,@P2,@P3,@P4,@P5,@P6',
    1
select @p1

SET FMTONLY ON exec sp_execute 64,0,0,0,0,0,' ' SET FMTONLY OFF

exec sp_unprepare 64

SET NO_BROWSETABLE OFF

exec sp_executesql 
    N'exec MyStoredProcedure @P1,@P2,@P3,@P4,@P5,@P6',
    N'@P1 int,@P2 int,@P3 int,@P4 int,@P5 int,@P6 varchar(20)',
    1,1,1,3,0,'400.00'
</code></pre>

<p>Which is a bit much for lil ol' me to follow, unfortunately. What sort of TADOConnection options could be influencing this?</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas?</p>

This works great in 99.999% of the cases but sometimes this suddenly fails and stops working permanently (maybe a restart of the parent process would solve this but this is undesirable and I don't want to recommend that until I solve the problem.) The failure is symptomized by external process not being invoked any more even though CreteProcess() doesn't report an error and by GetExitCodeProcess() returning 128. Here's the simplified version of what I'm doing:</p>

    // (it means that the thread was suspended but then restarted)

    // Wait for the external process to finish.
    DWORD waitForSingelObjectResult =  WaitForSingleObject(pi.hProcess, INFINITE);
    // WaitForSingleObject() returns 0 which is OK.

    // Get the exit code of the external process.

        // Error code 128 is ERROR_WAIT_NO_CHILDREN which would make some
        // sense *if* GetExitCodeProcess() returned FALSE and then I were to

<p>External process can be manually invoked from Windows Explorer or command line and it starts just fine on its own. Invoked like that it, before doing any real work, creates a log file and logs some information about it. But invoked like described above this logging information doesn't appear at all so I'm assuming that the main thread of the external process never enters main() (I'm testing that assumption now.)</p>

<p>There is at least one thing I could do to try to circumvent the problem (not start the thread suspended) but I would first like to understand the root of the failure first. Does anyone has any idea what could cause this and how to fix it?</p>

1674,139580,8945,2008-09-26T13:44:38Z,,6,Balanced Distribution Algorithm,"<p>I'm working on some code for a loosely coupled cluster. To achieve optimal performance during jobs, I have the cluster remap its data each time a child enters or exits. This will eventually be made optional, but for now it performs its data balancing by default. My balancing is basically just making sure that each child never has more than the average number of files per machine, plus one. The plus one is for the remainder if the division isn't clean. And since the remainder will <em>always</em> be less than the number of children [except 0 case, but we can exclude that], children after a balancing will have at most avg + 1.</p>

<p>Everything seems fine, until I realized my algorithm is O(n!). Go down the list of children, find out the avg, remainder, who has too many and who has too few. For each child in the too many list, go through list, send to each child who has too few.</p>

<p>Is there a better solution to this? I feel there must be.</p>

<p>Edit: Here is some psuedocode to show how i derived O(n!):</p>

The system is going to have a web interface and I want to use whatever webserver is there.</p>

<p>The web interface should be accessed under some URL that allows to have other URLs on the same webserver doing totally different things. I'm planning to use the path below that URL to specify what the web interface should do. It has facilities for use by other applications over the net and for humans to interact with in a browser.</p>

<p>Off the cuff, I'd work as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>make the webserver fire up a CGI process for every request it receives (like SetHandler in Apache)</li>
<li>let the CGI connect to the IPC</li>
<li>let it get whatever it needs from the backend services</li>
<li>let the CGI return HTML / XML and whatever HTTP Status based on the services' answers</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, what I really want is to avoid the first two steps, or if I can't, avoid the second one, because I'm afraid that I'm wasting performance on unneccesary overhead (the requests coming from other applications might be frequent).</p>

<p>PHP, for example, can open persistent connections to a MySQL database that survive the script's runtime and don't need to be recreated next time, though I don't know how they actually do it. Also, as I understand it, the Apache modules are loaded once when the server starts, so that might remove the first step but would tie me to Apache.</p>

<p>So, what are good ways to hook a handler for specific URLs into different webservers? I don't want to handle the HTTP, otherwise I might just use a proxy setup to a second server, but it just seems to be so reinventing-the-wheel. If you think, CGI is fine and have examples where it handles large numbers of request of a similar structure, please let me know.</p>

<p>Sometimes there will be files to ftp over, sometimes not.  If there are no files, I don't want the task nor the package to fail.  I've changed the arrow going from the ftp task to the next to ""completion"", so the package runs through.  I've changed the allowed number of errors to 4 (because there are 4 ftp tasks, and any of the 4 directories may or may not have files).  </p>

<p>But, when I run the package from a job in agent, it marks the job as failing.  Since this will be running every 15 minutes, I don't want a bunch of red x's in my job history, which will cause us to not see a problem when it really does occur.  </p>

<p>How do I set the properties in the ftp task so that not finding files to ftp is not a failure?  The operation I am using is ""Send files"".</p>

<p>Here is some more information: the files are on a server that I don't have any access through except ftp.  And, I don't know the filenames ahead of time.  The user can call them whatever they want.  So I can't check for specific files, nor, I think, can I check at all.  Except through using the ftp connection and tasks based upon that connection.  The files are on a remote server, and I want to copy them over to my server, to get them from that remote server.</p>

<p>I can shell a command level ftp in a script task.  Perhaps that is what I need to use instead of a ftp task.  (I have changed to use the ftp command line, with a parameter file, called from a script task.  It gives no errors when there are no files to get.  I think this solution is going to work for me.  I'm creating the parameter file dynamically, which means I don't need to have connection information in the plain text file, but rather can be stored in my configuration file, which is in a more secure location.)</p>

1695,141360,13220,2008-09-26T19:14:24Z,,1,Flex Post Event Screen Updates,"<p>I came across this topic today while investigating something very strange. Doing certain things in our Flex app can cause the number of frames rendered to rocket, from 12fps to ~30fps: loaded animations start playing at high speed and the GUI starts to lock up.</p>

<p>Since everything I've read on Flex/Flash hammers home the point ""the frame rate is capped at the fps set in the top level app"", it seems the only way these extra renders can be happening is due to some events causing them (no programmatic changes to the stage's framerate are done anywhere). Since it only happens when I put my update logic in the ENTER_FRAME handler, I'm trying to figure out what might be happening which to apparently causing Flex to go render-crazy.</p>

<p>Hypothesis: something in my update function is triggering an immediate screen update, this raises another ENTER_FRAME immediately, which means my update loop gets called, which triggers another immediate screen update, ...</p>

<p>We have Flex components used in our GUI, if this is a factor. I don't really know where to go next on this.</p>

<p><strong>Clarifications</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>When I say things speed up, there
are two ways this manifests.</li>
<li>Firstly, my ENTER_FRAME handler gets
called far more often.</li>
<li>Secondly, a
loaded Flash SWF with a looping
animation built in suddenly speeds
up to te point it looks silly.</li>
<li>I am not using updateAfterEvent, I only
found this existed when researching
this problem. Apparently, some
events on Sprite subclasses
automatically call this and I wonder
if that's the root cause.</li>
<li>I am not doing any direct messsing about with rendering at all. Background animations play automatically as they have timelines built-in from CS3 authoring, all our update function does is change the position of DisPlayObjects or add/remove them etc</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Update:</strong>
I added a label to my app to print out stage.frameRate, and discovered at certain times, it suddenly changes from 12 to 1000 (the maximum allowed value). While it was trivial to add a line to my ENTER_FRAME handler to reset it that's hardly a big help.
Also, even doing this, the rendering is all messed up. Certain actions (like raising an Alert popup) make it all spring back into life.
Unfortunately, I am not able to view the source of the Stage class to set a breakpoint on the setter property.</p>

<p>That's very interesting about the Flex loading 'set to 1000fps' thing. What we have are several Flex applications which all provide a common interface. A master app is in charge of loading these modules as required through the SWFLoader class. However, the loading process already takes into account the delayed loading... when the SWF loads we then wait for the APPLICATION_COMPLETE from the SystemManager. Once this is received, shouldn't the applications completion have occurred?</p>

<p>Problem I have is that when I add new column I need to add it also in HasChanges property and AcceptChanges() method. This just asks for some refactoring.<br>
So first solution that cames to my mind was something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IColumn
{
    bool HasChanges { get; }
    void AcceptChanges();
}

public struct Column&lt;T&gt; : IColumn {...}
public class Record
{
    Column&lt;int&gt; id;
    Column&lt;string&gt; name;
    Column&lt;DateTime?&gt; someDate;
    Column&lt;int?&gt; someInt;

    IColumn[] Columns { get { return new IColumn[] {id, name, someDate, someInt}; }}

    public bool HasChanges
    {
        get
        {
            bool has = false;
            IColumn[] columns = Columns;            //clone and boxing
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; columns.Length; i++)
                has |= columns[i].HasChanges;
            return has;
        }
    }

    public void AcceptChanges()
    {
        IColumn[] columns = Columns;            //clone and boxing
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; columns.Length; i++)
            columns[i].AcceptChanges();         //Here we are changing clone
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see from comments we have few problems here with struct cloning. Simple solution to this is to change Column to class, but from my tests it seems that it increases memory usage by ~40% (because of each object metadata) which is not acceptable for me.
<br>
<br>
So my question is: does anyone have any other ideas how to create methods that can work on different structured objects/records? Maybe someone from F# community can suggest how such problems are solved in functional languages and how it impacts performance and memory usage.

There are other processor approaches too, such as hyper-threading.</p>

<p>Some fancy compilers understand the (un)interrelatedness of instructions to a limited extent, and will automatically interleave instruction flows (probably over a longer window than the CPU sees) to better utilise the processor.  Deliberate compile-time interleaving of floating and integer instructions is another example of this.</p>

<p>Now I have highly-parallel task.  And I typically have an ageing single-core x86 processor without hyper-threading.</p>

<p>Is there a straight-forward way to get my the body of my 'for' loop for this highly-parallel task to be interleaved so that two (or more) iterations are being done together?  (This is slightly different from 'loop unwinding' as I understand it.)</p>

<p>My task is a 'virtual machine' running through a set of instructions, which I'll really simplify for illustration as:</p>

<pre>void run(int num) {
  for(int n=0; n&lt;num; n++) {
     vm_t data(n);
     for(int i=0; i&lt;data.len(); i++) {
        data.insn(i).parse();
        data.insn(i).eval();
     }
  }  
}</pre>

<p>So the execution trail might look like this:</p>

<pre>data(1) insn(0) parse
data(1) insn(0) eval
data(1) insn(1) parse
...
data(2) insn(1) eval
data(2) insn(2) parse
data(2) insn(2) eval</pre>

<p>Now, what I'd like is to be able to do two (or more) iterations explicitly in parallel:</p>

<pre>data(1) insn(0) parse
data(2) insn(0) parse  \ processor can do OOO as these two flow in
data(1) insn(0) eval   /
data(2) insn(0) eval   \ OOO opportunity here too
data(1) insn(1) parse  /
data(2) insn(1) parse</pre>

<p>I know, from profiling, (e.g. using Callgrind with --simulate-cache=yes), that parsing is about random memory accesses (cache missing) and eval is about doing ops in registers and then writing results back.  Each step is several thousand instructions long.  So if I can intermingle the two steps for two iterations at once, the processor will hopefully have something to do whilst the cache misses of the parse step are occurring...</p>

<p>Is there some c++ template madness to get this kind of explicit parallelism generated?</p>

<p>Of course I can do the interleaving - and even staggering - myself in code, but it makes for much less readable code.  And if I really want unreadable, I can go so far as assembler!  But surely there is some pattern for this kind of thing?</p>

<p>Just in case someone thinks about this; I thought about using a Boolean value but I don't really fancy it. First, how to associate true/false with left/right ? (Ok, I can use comments but I still find it dirty) and secondly, I might decide to add a new value, like 'justify', so if I have more than 2 possible values, Boolean type is definitely not possible to use.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

In your experience, what are their strengths, weaknesses, and unique features?  Assuming the luxury of choice, what factors would lead you to consider one over another other?</p>

<p>I'm most interested in people's direct experience with one or more frameworks, rather than an exhaustive comparison of everything out there.  Hopefully the SO community has programmers who have good and bad experiences with things like <a href=""http://www.rubyonrails.org/"">Rails</a>, <a href=""http://www.asp.net"">ASP.NET</a>, <a href=""http://www.djangoproject.com/"">Django</a>, <a href=""http://turbogears.org/"">TurboGears</a>, or <a href=""http://java.sun.com/javaee/javaserverfaces/"">JSF</a>.  It would also be great to hear if anyone is using one of the less mainstream frameworks like <a href=""http://www.seaside.st/"">Seaside</a> or <a href=""http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-weblocks/"">Weblocks</a>.</p>

<p>Programming language is an obvious difference, but a Java vs Ruby flamewar won't be much fun, and most of these frameworks seem to be at least as much an investment in technology, tools and complexity as their language of choice; so I'm more interested in things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Development speed and convenience</li>
<li>Barriers to entry - both in terms of developer training, and of infrastructure needed</li>
<li>Lock-in - how much code could you keep if you had to switch frameworks?</li>
<li>Flexibility - does the framework dictate your architecture or design?  (Whether that would be a good or bad thing is probably best left to a separate discussion.)</li>
<li>Performance, scalability, and stability - obviously depending on the developers!</li>

<ul>
<li>Have missing dependencies detected</li>
<li>Download and install dependencies from CPAN</li>
<li>Run a command to ""Build"" the source into a final state (perform any source parsing or configuration necessary for the local environment).</li>
<li>Run a command to install the built files into the appropriate locations.  Not only the perl modules, but also things like template (.tt) files, and CGI scripts, JS and image files that should be web-accessible.</li>
<li>Make sure proper permissions are set on installed files (and SELinux context if necessary).</li>
</ul>

<p>Right now we have a system based on <strong>Module::Build</strong> that does most of this. The work was done by done by my co-worker who was learning to use <strong>Module::Build</strong> at the time, and we'd like some advice on generalizing our solution, since it's fairly app-specific right now.  In particular, our system requires us to install dependencies by hand (although it does detect them).</p>

<p>Is there any particular system you've used that's been particularly successful?  Do you have to write an installer based on <strong>Module::Build</strong> or <strong>ExtUtils::MakeMaker</strong> that's particular to your application, or is something more general available?</p>

<ul>
<li>We can log into the machines</li>
<li>We do not have root access to the machines</li>
<li>The machines are all (ostensibly) identical builds of RHEL5 with SELinux enabled</li>
<li>Currently, the people installing the machines are only programmers from our group, and our source is not available to the general public.  However, it's conceivable our source could eventually be installed on someone else's machines in our organization, to be installed by their programmers or systems people.</li>

<p>EDIT: For those who want more details...</p>

<p>We work with a discrete event simulation used by the military.  Important simulation events are thus when weapons are fired, when kills occur, and also when weapons fail to kill a target.  Other important events are when targets are detected or when they are no longer tracked.  We keep pretty detailed log files that we then mine to calculate averages and other statistics.  It's mainly the statistics that I'm concerned with storing in the database.  </p>

<p>Another thing I want to include is the case ID.  We identify different cases using an alphanumeric case ID string that corresponds to a particular combination of systems and important input parameters.  For example, suppose a sensor could detect a target at 3 different ranges depending on mode, there would be a character in the case ID that corresponds to each level of detection range, labeled 0, 1, or 2.  If there are enough levels of a given case, the case ID characters switch to letters after 9.  This case ID would definitely be an important key in the database.  Once we have stored the data, we need to retrieve certain numbers to make charts comparing different cases.  We currently make the charts in Excel, but I've been adding more MATLAB recently.</p>

<p>As for the database technology, I thought I'd do the table design in Access to prototype things, then implement it in MS SQL Server.  I'm planning to use Ruby to create HTML reports with data tables and graphs.</p>

The engine I'm using for this is entirely unicode-friendly, so I'd like to keep that if at all possible.  The problem is that the rendering loop looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>""string"".each_byte do |c|
    render_this_letter(c)
end
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know a whole lot about i18n, but I know enough to know the above code is only ever going to work for me and people who speak my language.  I'd prefer something like:</p>

<pre><code>""unicode string"".each_unicode_letter do |u|

The main question I have about this can be boiled down to the following two graphs:</p>

<p> (if graph doesn't show up, click here or visit this link: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/86396568@N00/2893003041/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flickr.com/photos/86396568@N00/2893003041/</a></p>

<p>To my eyes, A is in a stronger position than a.  I am judging strength by how strong a node can remain if a link is knocked out.  I'd call the first a thin ""stilt"", and the second a thick ""stalk"".</p>

<p>Here are the approaches I've considered so far for judging the strength of a node:</p>

<p>1) Counting the number of nodes below, subtracting the number of nodes above.</p>

<ul>
<li>A=7, a=7, B=5, b=1</li>
</ul>

<p>2) Counting the number of complete paths (to termination) for each node, summing their lengths.</p>

<ul>
<li>A=17 (1+5+5+5+1), B=12 (4+4+4), a=9 (3+3+3), b=2</li>
<li>This make the stilt stronger, rather than the stalk.</li>
</ul>

<p>3) Counting every possible path, treating every node as a destination.</p>

<ul>
<li>A=9 (A->B, A->C, A->D, A->E, A->G, 2xA->F, 2xA->H), B=6, a=9, b=2</li>
</ul>

<p>3 seems like the best option so far, but is there one that is better, generalized for DAGs?  Is this something that has a known best approach?  The principles are to use as much information in the graph as possible, and for the solution to be explainable in an intuitive way.</p>

<p>The database may give it 20 or 30 items a second in the beginning, but that begins to decline rapidly, eventually reaching about 65K items over 24 hours, at which point the application exits.</p>

<code>glBlendFunc(GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA), </code>
the resulting blit causes the destination texture alpha to change, making it slightly transparent for places where alpha previously was 1. I would like the destination surface alpha never to change, but otherwise the effect on RGB values should be exactly like with <code>GL_SRC_ALPHA</code> and <code>GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA</code>. So the blend factor functions should be (As,As,As,0) and (1-As,1-As,1-As,1). How can I achieve that?</p>

<p>I have a vehicle object, which has location, velocity and accelleration members (among other things) and an update method, during which it updates its location based on its velocity, and its vevlocity based on its accelleration.</p>

<p>I have a game object which contains the game loop, which calls the update method on the vehicle.</p>

<p>If the player controls the vehicle with the arrow keys, should a keypress set the accelleration (push) and a key-release clear the velocity, or should the vehicle ask the game-engine if the accellerate key is pressed (pull)?  I think a push would mean that the keyboard control module would need to know about vehicles, whereas pull would mean a vehicle needs to know specific keyboard controls.</p>

<p>I think a related question would be something like: should all objects know about all other objects, or should there be a strict hierarchy, so objects can ask things / tell things to other objects up the tree, but not down (or vice-versa)?</p>

<p>An example of what I'm after is, the use of GUIDs instead of sequential numbers for allocation of primary keys. Rationale for GUIDs is that handlers have their own primary key generators without ""consulting"" each other. This allows for parallel processing to occur and permits scaling.</p>

<p>I have spent the entire day troubleshooting a client's network on which our application runs unacceptably slowly, when connecting the a SQL 2005 Express named instance across the ""network"".  </p>

<p>I say ""network"" because it is only two XP SP2 machines - there is no dedicated server here. No AD.</p>

<p>In trying to isolate this problem I have installed SQL 2005 Express on both machines and placed copies of our database on both machines. I have even completely reinstalled our application using the SQL2005 Express install routine we now have. It makes no difference whether I restore an old MSDE database or use a newly created SQL 2005 Express one.</p>

<p>When running our application and connecting to either machine's local server performance is fine. Once you connect our application on either PC to the server on the other PC, it is unworkably slow. (Regardless of the combination).</p>

<p>Now, I have rebuilt statistics (exec sp_updatestats), rebuilt ALL indexes, disabled (temporarily) firewalls and virus software and clutched and countless other straws.</p>

<p>I have resorted to running FileMon and ProcessMon on both machines and have even written a little test application to simply connect and query a table in the database. It too runs slowly - (takes about 5 - 6 seconds to connect).</p>

<p>The problem is that that something doesn't smell right with the DLL &amp; namespace structure, and I'd like to know if there are any performance impacts.</p>

<p>The main web app is ""Foo"", and generates Foo.dll.  Foo.dll contains namespace App.Foo, which contains the classes for all the pages, user controls, etc.</p>

<p>There's also a project ""FooLib"" that generates FooLib.dll.  FooLib.dll also contains an App.Foo namespace, which contains a bunch of class definitions.  There are a few other namespaces like App.Foo.Data, App.Foo.Logic, etc.</p>

<p>Is there anything wrong with this?  How does the runtime find a class across multiple DLLs?</p>

1819,149380,7290,2008-09-29T16:04:19Z,,104,Dynamic Sorting within SQL Stored Procedures,"<p>This is an issue that I've spent hours researching in the past.  It seems to me to be something that should have been addressed by modern <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational%5Fdatabase%5Fmanagement%5Fsystem"">RDBMS</a> solutions but as yet I have not found anything that really addresses what I see to be an incredibly common need in any Web or Windows application with a database back-end.</p>

<p>I speak of dynamic sorting.  In my fantasy world, it should be as simple as something like:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY @sortCol1, @sortCol2
</code></pre>

<p>This is the canonical example given by newbie SQL and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored%5Fprocedure"">Stored Procedure</a> developers all over forums across the Internet.  ""Why isn't this possible?"" they ask.  Invariably, somebody eventually comes along to lecture them about the compiled nature of stored procedures, of execution plans in general, and all sorts of other reasons why it isn't possible to put a parameter directly into an <code>ORDER BY</code> clause.</p>

<hr>

<p>I know what some of you are already thinking:  ""Let the client do the sorting, then.""  Naturally, this offloads the work from your database.  In our case though, our database servers aren't even breaking a sweat 99% of the time and they aren't even multi-core yet or any of the other myriad improvements to system architecture that happen every 6 months.  For this reason alone, having our databases handle sorting wouldn't be a problem.  Additionally, databases are <em>very</em> good at sorting.  They are optimized for it and have had years to get it right, the language for doing it is incredibly flexible, intuitive, and simple and above all any beginner SQL writer knows how to do it and even more importantly they know how to edit it, make changes, do maintenance, etc.  When your databases are far from being taxed and you just want to simplify (and shorten!) development time this seems like an obvious choice.</p>

<p>Then there's the web issue.  I've played around with JavaScript that will do client-side sorting of HTML tables, but they inevitably aren't flexible enough for my needs and, again, since my databases aren't overly taxed and can do sorting really <em>really</em> easily, I have a hard time justifying the time it would take to re-write or roll-my-own JavaScript sorter.  The same generally goes for server-side sorting, though it is already probably much preferred over JavaScript.  I'm not one that particularly likes the overhead of DataSets, so sue me.</p>

<p>But this brings back the point that it isn't possible &mdash; or rather, not easily.  I've done, with prior systems, an incredibly hack way of getting dynamic sorting.  It wasn't pretty, nor intuitive, simple, or flexible and a beginner SQL writer would be lost within seconds.  Already this is looking to be not so much a ""solution"" but a ""complication.""</p>

<hr>

<p>The following examples are not meant to expose any sort of best practices or good coding style or anything, nor are they indicative of my abilities as a T-SQL programmer.  They are what they are and I fully admit they are confusing, bad form, and just plain hack.</p>

<p>We pass an integer value as a parameter to a stored procedure (let's call the parameter just ""sort"") and from that we determine a bunch of other variables.  For example... let's say sort is 1 (or the default):</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @sortCol1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @sortCol2 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @dir1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @dir2 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @col1 AS varchar(20)
DECLARE @col2 AS varchar(20)

SET @col1 = 'storagedatetime';
SET @col2 = 'vehicleid';

IF @sort = 1                -- Default sort.
BEGIN
    SET @sortCol1 = @col1;
    SET @dir1 = 'asc';
    SET @sortCol2 = @col2;
    SET @dir2 = 'asc';
END
ELSE IF @sort = 2           -- Reversed order default sort.
BEGIN
    SET @sortCol1 = @col1;
    SET @dir1 = 'desc';
    SET @sortCol2 = @col2;
    SET @dir2 = 'desc';
END
</code></pre>

<p>You can already see how if I declared more @colX variables to define other columns I could really get creative with the columns to sort on based on the value of ""sort""... to use it, it usually ends up looking like the following incredibly messy clause:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY
    CASE @dir1
        WHEN 'desc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol1
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END DESC,
    CASE @dir1
        WHEN 'asc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol1
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END,
    CASE @dir2
        WHEN 'desc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol2
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END DESC,
    CASE @dir2
        WHEN 'asc' THEN
            CASE @sortCol2
                WHEN @col1 THEN [storagedatetime]
                WHEN @col2 THEN [vehicleid]
            END
    END
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this is a very stripped down example.  The real stuff, since we usually have four or five columns to support sorting on, each with possible secondary or even a third column to sort on in addition to that (for example date descending then sorted secondarily by name ascending) and each supporting bi-directional sorting which effectively doubles the number of cases.  Yeah... it gets hairy really quick.</p>

<p>The idea is that one could ""easily"" change the sort cases such that vehicleid gets sorted before the storagedatetime... but the pseudo-flexibility, at least in this simple example, really ends there.  Essentially, each case that fails a test (because our sort method doesn't apply to it this time around) renders a NULL value.  And thus you end up with a clause that functions like the following:</p>

<pre><code>ORDER BY NULL DESC, NULL, [storagedatetime] DESC, blah blah
</code></pre>

<p>You get the idea.  It works because SQL Server effectively ignores null values in order by clauses.  This is incredibly hard to maintain, as anyone with any basic working knowledge of SQL can probably see.  If I've lost any of you, don't feel bad.  It took us a long time to get it working and we still get confused trying to edit it or create new ones like it.  Thankfully it doesn't need changing often, otherwise it would quickly become ""not worth the trouble.""</p>

<p>Yet it <em>did</em> work.</p>

<hr>

<p>My question is then:  <strong>is there a better way?</strong></p>

<p>I'm okay with solutions other than Stored Procedure ones, as I realize it may just not be the way to go.  Preferably, I'd like to know if anyone can do it better within the Stored Procedure, but if not, how do you all handle letting the user dynamically sort tables of data (bi-directionally, too) with ASP.NET?</p>

<p>And thank you for reading (or at least skimming) such a long question!</p>

<p>PS: Be glad I didn't show my example of a stored procedure that supports dynamic sorting, dynamic filtering/text-searching of columns, pagination via ROWNUMBER() OVER, <em>AND</em> try...catch with transaction rollbacking on errors... ""behemoth-sized"" doesn't even begin to describe them.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I would like to <strong>avoid dynamic SQL</strong>.  Parsing a string together and running an EXEC on it defeats a lot of the purpose of having a stored procedure in the first place.  Sometimes I wonder though if the cons of doing such a thing wouldn't be worth it, at least in these special dynamic sorting cases.  Still, I always feel dirty whenever I do dynamic SQL strings like that &mdash; like I'm still living in the Classic ASP world.</li>
<li>A lot of the reason we want stored procedures in the first place is for <strong>security</strong>.  I don't get to make the call on security concerns, only suggest solutions.  With SQL Server 2005 we can set permissions (on a per-user basis if need be) at the schema level on individual stored procedures and then deny any queries against the tables directly.  Critiquing the pros and cons of this approach is perhaps for another question, but again it's not my decision.  I'm just the lead code monkey. :)</li>

After an application upgrade the site started to hang from time to time and I was sent in to debug. After checking the event log I found that the SQL-server wrote ~200 000 events in a couple of minutes with the message saying that a constraint had failed. After much debugging and some tracing I found the culprit. I've removed some unnecessary code and cleaned it up a bit but essentially this is it</p>

<pre><code>WHILE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM ShoppingCartItem WHERE ShoppingCartItem.PurchID = @PurchID)
BEGIN
	SELECT TOP 1 
		@TmpGFSID = ShoppingCartItem.GFSID, 
		@TmpQuantity = ShoppingCartItem.Quantity,
		@TmpShoppingCartItemID = ShoppingCartItem.ShoppingCartItemID,
	FROM
		ShoppingCartItem INNER JOIN GoodsForSale on ShoppingCartItem.GFSID = GoodsForSale.GFSID
	WHERE ShoppingCartItem.PurchID = @PurchID

	EXEC @ErrorCode = spGoodsForSale_ReverseReservations @TmpGFSID, @TmpQuantity
	IF @ErrorCode &lt;&gt; 0
	BEGIN
		Goto Cleanup	
	END

	DELETE FROM ShoppingCartItem WHERE ShoppingCartItem.ShoppingCartItemID = @TmpShoppingCartItemID
	-- @@ROWCOUNT is 1 after this
END
</code></pre>

<p>Facts:</p>

<ol>
<li>There's only one or two records matching the first select-clause</li>
<li>RowCount from the DELETE statement indicates that it has been removed</li>
<li>The WHILE-clause will loop forever</li>
</ol>

<p>The procedure has been rewritten to select the rows that should be deleted into a temporary in-memory table instead so the immediate problem is solved but this really sparked my curiosity.</p>

<p>Why does it loop forever?</p>

<p><strong>Clarification</strong>: The delete doesn't fail (@@rowcount is 1 after the delete stmt when debugged)
<strong>Clarification 2</strong>: It shouldn't matter whether or not the SELECT TOP ... clause is ordered by any specific field since the record with the returned id will be deleted so in the next loop it should get another record.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: After checking the subversion logs I found the culprit commit that made this stored procedure to go haywire. The only real difference that I can find is that there previously was no join in the SELECT TOP 1 statement i.e. without that join it worked without any transaction statements surrounding the delete.

<p>Currently, I have a compatibilty function for users which could come into play. It ranks users on having 1) rated similar items 2) rated the item similarly. The function weighs point 2 heigher and this would be the most important if I had to use only one of these factors when generating 'neighbours'.</p>

<p>One idea I had would be to just calculate the compatibilty of every combination of users and selecting the highest rated users to be the neighbours for the user. The downside of this is that as the number of users go up then this process couls take a very long time. For just a 1000 users, it needs 1000C2 (0.5 * 1000 * 999 = = 499 500) calls to the compatibility function which could be very heavy on the server also.</p>

<p>So I am looking for any advice, links to articles etc on how best to achieve a system like this.</p>

<p><strong>I will let my original explenation stand, but here's a set of sample data and the result i expect:</strong></p>

<p>Ok, so here's some sample data, i separated pairs by a blank line</p>

<pre><code>-------------
| Key |  Col | (Together they from a Unique Pair)
--------------
|  1     Foo |
|  1     Bar |
|            |
|  2     Foo |
|            |
|  3     Bar |
|            |
|  4     Foo |
|  4     Bar |
--------------
</code></pre>

<p>And the result I would expect, <strong>after running the query once</strong>, it need to be able to select this result set in one query:</p>

<pre><code>1 - Foo
2 - Foo
3 - Bar
4 - Foo
</code></pre>

<p><em>Original explenation:</em></p>

<p>I have a table, call it <code>TABLE</code> where I have a two columns say <code>ID</code> and <code>NAME</code> which together form the primary key of the table. Now I want to select something where <code>ID=1</code> and then first checks if it can find a row where <code>NAME</code> has the value ""John"", if ""John"" does not exist it should look for a row where <code>NAME</code> is ""Bruce"" - but only return ""John"" if both ""Bruce"" and ""John"" exists or only ""John"" exists of course.</p>

<p>Also note that it should be able to return several rows per query that match the above criteria but with different ID/Name-combinations of course, and that the above explanation is just a simplification of the real problem.</p>

<p>I could be completely blinded by my own code and line of thought but I just can't figure this out. </p>

<p>Given a list of strings, find the substring which, if subtracted from the beginning of all strings where it matches and replaced by an escape byte, gives the shortest total length.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<p><code>""foo""</code>, <code>""fool""</code>, <code>""bar""</code></p>

<p>The result is: ""foo"" as the base string with the strings <code>""\0""</code>, <code>""\0l""</code>, <code>""bar""</code> and a total length of 9 bytes. <code>""\0""</code> is the escape byte. The sum of the length of the original strings is 10, so in this case we only saved one byte.</p>

<p><strong>A naive algorithm would look like:</strong></p>

<pre><code>for string in list
  for i = 1, i &lt; length of string
      calculate total length based on prefix of string[0..i]
      if better than last best, save it
return the best prefix

I am thinking of adding buttons and/or keyboard shortcuts for starting and stopping the capture; when starting, I could ask for a filename and other options, if any. It has to run in Windows (XP/Vista), but I also wouldn't like to close the Linux door which I've so far been able to keep open.</p>

<p>The application uses OpenGL fragment and shader programs, the effects due to which I absolutely need to have in the eventual videos.</p>

<p>It looks to me like there might be even several different approaches that could potentially fulfill my requirements (but I don't really know where I should start):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>An encoding library with functions like startRecording(filename), stopRecording, and captureFrame. I could call captureFrame() after every frame rendered (or every second/third/whatever). If doing so makes my program run slower, it's not really a problem.</p></li>
<li><p>A standalone external program that can be programmatically controlled from my application. After all, a standalone program that can <em>not</em> be controlled almost does what I need... But as said, it should be really simple for the users to operate, and I would appreciate seamlessness as well; my application typically runs full-screen. Additionally, it should be possible to distribute as part of the installation package for my application, which I currently prepare using NSIS.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the Windows API to capture screenshots frame-by-frame, then employ (for example) one of the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/93954/how-to-programatically-create-videos"">libraries mentioned here</a>. It seems to be easy enough to find examples of how to capture screenshots in Windows; however, I would love a solution which doesn't really force me to get my hands super-dirty on the WinAPI level.</p></li>
<li><p>Use OpenGL to render into an offscreen target, then use a library to produce the video. I don't know if this is even possible, and I'm afraid it might not be the path of least pain anyway. In particular, I would not like the actual rendering to take a different execution path depending on whether video is being captured or not. Additionally, I would avoid anything that might decrease the frame rate in the normal, non-capture mode.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If the solution were free in either sense of the word, then that would be great, but it's not really an absolute requirement. In general, the less bloat there is, the better. On the other hand, for reasons beyond this question, I cannot link in any GPL-only code, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Regarding the file format, I cannot expect my users to start googling for any codecs, but as long as also <em>displaying</em> the videos is easy enough for a basic-level Windows user, I don't really care what the format is. However, it would be great if it were possible to control the compression quality of the output.</p>

<p>Just to clarify: I <em>don't</em> need to capture video from an external device like camcorder, nor am I really interested in mouse movements, even though getting them does not harm either. There are no requirements regarding audio; the application makes no noise whatsoever.</p>

<p>I write C++ using Visual Studio 2008, for this very application also taking benefit of GLUT and GLUI. I have a solid understanding regarding C++ and linking in libraries and that sort of stuff, but on the other hand OpenGL is quite new for me: so far, I've really only learnt the necessary bits to actually get my job done.</p>

<p>I don't need a solution super-urgently, so feel free to take your time :)</p>

I'd like to save these credentials with the other user settings, but for security reasons, the password needs to be encrypted.</p>

<p>The following code works fine:</p>

<pre><code>user.Network.AdminID = 0;
db.SubmitChanges();

<p>However, if I access the AdminID before making the change, the change never happens to the DB.  So the following doesn't work:</p>

<pre><code>if(user.Network.AdminID == user.UserID)
{
     user.Network.AdminID = 0;
     db.SubmitChanges();
}

<p>It is making it into the if statement and calling submit changes.  For some reason, the changes to AdminID never make it to the DB.  No error thrown, the change just never 'takes'.</p>

<p>Any idea what could be causing this?</p>

<p>We don't have ""releases"" per se: if a feature is big enough to be noticeable, we push it live (after requisite testing/etc.), otherwise we batch a few up and, when it feels ""comfortable"", push those live. The goal is to never have a deploy more than once or twice a month or so because a constantly shifting site tends to make the users a bit uneasy.</p>

<p>Here's how we do it, and it feels sort of brittle (currently using svn but considering a switch to git):</p>

<ol>
<li>Two ""branches"" - DEV and STAGE with a given release of STAGE marked as TRUNK</li>
<li>Developer checks out a copy of TRUNK for every change and creates a branch for it</li>
<li>Developer works locally, checking in code frequently (just like voting: early and often)</li>
<li>When Developer is comfortable it isn't totally broken, merge the branch with DEV and deploy to the development site.</li>
<li>Repeat 3-4 as necessary until the change is ""finished""</li>
<li>Merge change branch with STAGING, deploy to stage site. Do expected final testing.</li>
<li>After some period of time, mark a given revision of STAGE as the TRUNK, and push trunk live</li>
<li>Merge TRUNK changes back down to DEV to keep it in sync</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, some of these steps have significant complexity hand-waved away and in practice are very difficult to do (TRUNK -> DEV always breaks) so I have to imagine there's a better way.</p>

<p>In my opinion, this beats the intention of writing a loop: you loop because there is something common to be done for each of the elements.  Using this construct, for some of the elements you do something different.  So, I conclude, you need a separate loop for those elements:</p>

<pre><code>i = begin
mid = ( end - begin ) / 2 //(the middle element)
while ( i != mid ) {

<p>Ultimately I want to be able to make my whole classic ASP intranet the ""root"" and have ASP.NET ""sub-applications"" that can still access /style and /img and, I guess for ASP.NET I'll have /masterpages.</p>

<p>I've tried this before, but I think VS choked on the couple of hundred classic ASP pages that it added to the ""project"" when I made my existing intranet root directory the ASP.NET project root (via File->Open->Web Site). I'd be nice to edit my existing classic ASP intranet using VS 2008 SP1 (I currently use the excellent <a href=""http://notepad-plus.sourceforge.net/uk/site.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Notepad++</a>) because I'd like to get more hands on with VS but I guess this isn't absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>I also tried treating each new ASP.NET application as an application in its own right, effectively making the /dotnetapp_1 directory the ""root"" of the application (again, via File->Open->Web Site in VS2008). However, VS then complained when I tried to reference /masterpages because it ""belonged to another application."" I think I kludged it by adding a virtual directory inside each ASP.NET directory that ""pointed"" to the root /masterpages but I'm not sure VS was able to happily provide WYSIWYG editing when I did this, as opposed to making a copy of the masterpage in every ASP.NET application I add to the intranet.</p>

<p>I'm also quite likely to visit the .NET MVC framework so please offer any answers with that framework in mind. I'm hoping ""projects"" aren't quite to important with MVC and that rather it's just a bunch of files that creates an application that contributes to the whole (that being the intranet).</p>

<p>So, the question is: <strong>How I can best add-on ASP.NET applications to an existing classic ASP intranet (I'm not concerned about the technicalities of session sharing between classic ASP and ASP.NET, only the structural layout of directories and projects) and be able to edit these separate applications in Visual Studio 2008 SP1 and yet have these application ""related"" to each other by a common, intranet look and feel*?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Please don't just post the answer ""use MasterPages."" I appreciate MasterPages are .NET's method of sharing styles (and more probably) between related pages in the <em>same</em> application. I get that. What I'm looking for is the best method of adding ASP.NET applications into the existing intranet as smoothly as I can that makes editing each application simple and where each application can share (if possible) an intranet-common style.</li>

<p>I am moving from absolute positioning toward CSS relative positioning.</p>

<p>I'd like to divide the screen into four blocks: top (header band), middle left (a stacked menu), middle right (content - here the AJAX tab container), and bottom (footer band), with all 4 blocks positioned relatively, but the controls in the middle right (content) block positioned absolutely relative to the top left corner of the block. A nice side benefit would be to have the IDE design window show all controls as they actually would be displayed, but I doubt this is possible.  The IDE is positioning all controls inside the tab panels relative to the top left of the design window; quite a mess.</p>

<p>Right now, my prejudice is that CSS is good for relatively positioning blocks, artwork, text etc, but not good for input forms where it is important to  line up lots of labels, text boxes, ddl's, check boxes, etc.</p>

<p>At any rate, my CSS is not yet up to the task - does anyone know of a good article, book, blog, etc which discusses CSS as it is implemented in ASP.NET, and which might include an example with an AJAX tab control?  Any help would be appreciated. </p>

<p>Currently all of our developers use the version of Tortise built for SVN 1.4 and our SVN server is running 1.4. Our build server is running CC.Net and is using SVN 1.4.</p>

<p>We want to upgrade. </p>

<p>I've established that upgrading our clients to 1.5, then our server to 1.5 will work for us. However, the question comes in with CC.Net. Can we just upgrade the install of SVN on our build server to SVN 1.5? Or do we have to upgrade the install of CC.Net too? We'd like to also take this time to upgrade CC.Net, however, we'd like to make sure the SVN upgrade is done first, then come back and do CC.Net.</p>

<p>Also adding to this mix is that in some of our projects we maintain a 'tools' folder that may or may not contain the binaries for SVN due to the nAnt scripts we use in those projects. I assume that if we upgrade the CC.Net server install of SVN to 1.5, we'll also need to update all of those projects as the CI server uses the same working directory as the nAnt scripts that get executed.</p>

<ol>
<li>sets recognized properties for an ftp server to put and get xml input and a jms queue server that keeps track of jobs. Remotely there waits a server that actually parses the xml once a queue message is received.</li>
<li>creates a remote directory using ftp and starts a queue connection using mqconnectionfactory to the given address of the queue server.</li>
<li>once the new queue entry is made in 2), the filter waits for a new queue message to appear signifying the job has been completed by the remote server. The filter then grabs the modified xml file from the ftp and passes it along to the next filter. </li>
</ol>

<p>The JUnit test I am working on simply needs to emulate this environment by starting a local ftp and mock queue server for the filter to connect to, then waiting for the filter to connect to the queue and put the new xml input file on a local directory via a local ftp server, wait for the queue message and then modify the xml input slightly, put the modified xml in a new directory and post another message to the queue signifying the job has completed. </p>

<p>All of the tutorials I have found on the net have used EJB and JNDI to lookup the queue server once it has been made. If possible, I'd like to sidestep that route by just creating a mock queue on my local machine and connecting to it in the simplest manner possible, not using EJB and JNDI.</p>

1956,159240,11208,2008-10-01T19:14:04Z,,44,RAII vs. exceptions,"<p>The more we use RAII in C++, the more we find ourselves with destructors that do non-trivial deallocation. Now, deallocation (finalization, however you want to call it) can fail, in which case exceptions are really the only way to let anybody upstairs know of our deallocation problem. But then again, throwing-destructors are a bad idea because of the possibility of exceptions being thrown during stack unwinding. <code>std::uncaught_exception()</code> lets you know when that happens, but not much more, so aside from letting you log a message before termination there's not much you can do, unless you're willing to leave your program in an undefined state, where some stuff is deallocated/finalized and some not.</p>

<p>One approach is to have no-throw destructors. But in many cases that just hides a real error. Our destructor might, for example, be closing some RAII-managed DB connections as a result of some exception being thrown, and those DB connections might fail to close. This doesn't necessarily mean we're ok with the program terminating at this point. On the other hand, logging and tracing these errors isn't really a solution for every case; otherwise we would have had no need for exceptions to begin with. 
With no-throw destructors we also find ourselves having to create ""reset()"" functions that are supposed to be called before destruction - but that just defeats the whole purpose of RAII.</p>

<p>Another approach is just to <a href=""http://www.kolpackov.net/projects/c++/eh/dtor-1.xhtml"">let the program terminate</a>, as it's the most predictable thing you can do.</p>

<p>Some people suggest chaining exceptions, so that more than one error can be handled at a time. But I honestly never actually seen that done in C++ and I've no idea how to implement such a thing.</p>

<p>So it's either RAII or exceptions. Isn't it? I'm leaning toward no-throw destructors; mainly because it keeps things simple(r). But I really hope there's a better solution, because, as I said, the more we use RAII, the more we find ourselves using dtors that do non-trivial things.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""For an Expander to work correctly, do not specify a Height on the Expander control when the ExpandDirection property is set to Down or Up. Similarly, do not specify a Width on the Expander control when the ExpandDirection property is set to Left or Right. When you set a size on the Expander control in the direction that the expanded content is displayed, the area that is defined by the size parameter is displayed with a border around it. This area displays even when the window is collapsed. To set the size of the expanded window, set size dimensions on the content of the Expander control or the ScrollViewer that encloses the content.""</p>

A subscriber has successfully replicated a row from the publisher, using transactional replication. Now, how do we keep track the time of this row being last successfully replicated?  </p>

<p>A friend has suggested the following solution, which he used for his SQL Server 2000:<br />
1) Add a datetime column.<br />
2) Change the replication stored procedure to update the datetime column (!).</p>

<p>The step #2 sets off all sorts of warning bells within me, so I'm asking if there are better solutions for SQL Server 2005 in this situation, before I even go into detail with his solution. </p>

<p>I have pursued small personal game projects on and off throughout my programming career. I've found the (often) strict performance requirements and escalating design complexity have taught me some of my most useful programming lessons.  </p>

<p>In these projects to name just a few, I very quickly came face to face with: ""Everything is fast for small N"".  I also discovered the hard way about using basic object oriented design principles to manage complexity.</p>

<p>In a field where many technologies and topics can be quite dry/dull, I think hobby game development is important in motivating new (and not so new) developers to brush up on essential skills while having fun at the same time. </p>
